10.1101/2020.08.19.20178343,"The Effects of Coronavirus Victimization Distress and Coronavirus Racial Bias on Mental Health Among AIAN, Asian, Black, and Latinx Young Adults","Fisher, C. B.; Tao, X.; Yip, T.",Celia B. Fisher,Dr,2021-06-01,4,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,cc_by_nc_nd,psychiatry and clinical psychology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/01/2020.08.19.20178343.source.xml,"RationaleU.S. Racial/ethnic minorities have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in rates of infection and morbidity. Pre-pandemic racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of Coronavirus specific forms of discrimination on mental health have not been examined. This study assessed the effect of previously identified social determinants of mental health and COVID-19 specific victimization and racial bias beliefs on depression and anxiety among young adults of color in the U.S.

MethodsA national online survey of 399 AIAN, Asian, Black, and Latinx adults (18 - 25 years) included demographic variables, COVID-19 health risks, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, Coronavirus related victimization distress and perceptions of Coronavirus-related racial bias across a range of contexts.

ResultsEmployment, financial and prescription insecurity, COVID-19 health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs were positively correlated with depression and anxiety. Scores on the Coronavirus racial bias scale were significantly higher among Asian and Black respondents. Structural equation modeling controlling for race/ethnicity and demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health indices.

ConclusionResults suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.",NA,medrxiv

Degradation of resting-state networks in AD has been observed when FC is estimated over the entire scan, however, the temporal dynamics of these networks are less studied. We implemented a novel approach to investigate the modular structure of static (sFC) and time-varying (tvFC) connectivity along the AD spectrum in a two-sample Discovery/Validation design (n=80 and 81, respectively). Cortical FC networks were estimated across 4 diagnostic groups (cognitively normal, subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and AD) for whole scan (sFC) and with sliding window correlation (tvFC). Modularity quality (across a range of spatial scales) did not differ in either sFC or tvFC. For tvFC, group differences in temporal stability within and between multiple resting state networks were observed; however, these differences were not consistent between samples. Correlation analyses identified a relationship between global cognition and temporal stability of the ventral attention network, which was reproduced in both samples. While the ventral attention system has been predominantly studied in task-evoked designs, the relationship between its intrinsic dynamics at-rest and general cognition along the AD spectrum highlights its relevance regarding clinical manifestation of the disease.",10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102726,medrxiv

We therefore developed a flexible individual-based mathematical model for HIV transmission, that comprises a spatial representation and individual-level determinants. We tested this model by calibrating it to the HIV epidemic in Malawi and exploring whether the heterogeneity in HIV prevalence could be caused without accounting for heterogeneity in behaviour. We ran the model for Malawi between years 1975-2030 with five alternative realizations of the geographical structure and mobility: (I) no geographical structure; 28 administrative districts including (II) only permanent relocations between districts, (III) permanent relocations and between-district casual sexual relationships, or (IV) permanent relocations between districts and to/from abroad and between-district casual sex; and (V) a grid of 10x10km2 cells, with permanent relocations and between-cell casual relationships. We assumed HIV was present in 1975 in the districts with >10% prevalence in 2010. We calibrated the models to national and district-level prevalence estimates.

Reaching the national prevalence required all adults to have at least 20 casual sex acts/year until 1990. Models II, III and V reproduced the geographical heterogeneity in prevalence to some extent if between-district relationships were either excluded (Model II) or restricted to minimum (Models III, V). Long-distance casual partnership mixing (Models III-V) mitigated the differences in prevalence substantially; with international migration the differences disappeared completely (Model IV). National prevalence was projected to decrease to 4-5% by 2030. Our model sustained the major differences in HIV prevalence across Malawi, if casual relationships between districts were kept at sufficiently low level. An earlier introduction of HIV into the Southern part of Malawi may thus be one of the explanations to the present heterogeneity in HIV prevalence.

Author summaryThe prevalence of HIV varies greatly across the settings, both globally and within countries. The ability of the commonly used compartmental models to account for the geographical structure and individual-level determinants that cause this heterogeneity is limited. In this project, we developed an individual-based simulation framework for modelling HIV transmission in a real setting. We built the model to take into account an unlimited number of individual-level characteristics, and a geographical representation of the setting that can be defined using an arbitrary resolution and distance matrices. We demonstrate the use of this model by simulating the HIV epidemic of Malawi 1975-2030 and exploring whether the observed heterogeneity could be preserved without taking into account any spatial heterogeneity in sexual behaviour. A relatively simple version of the model reproduced the broad-scale differences in HIV prevalence, but the detailed differences will need further investigation.",NA,medrxiv

The second objective was to explore the acceptability of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA prospective pre-post study was conducted with first time mothers in Nova Scotia, Canada between July 15th and September 19th, 2020. Participants completed a self-report survey at enrolment (after birth) and six-weeks postpartum. Various standardized measures were used and qualitative feedback on the program was also collected. Paired t-tests were carried out to determine changes from baseline to follow-up on psychosocial outcomes and qualitative feedback was analysed through thematic analysis.

ResultsA total of 88 women enrolled. Self-efficacy increased between baseline (B) and follow-up (F) (B:33.33; F:37.11, p=0.000) while anxiety (STAI) declined (B:38.49; F:34.79; p=0.004). In terms of acceptability, 89% of participants felt that the number of messages were just right, 84.5% felt the messages contained all the information they needed relative to caring for a newborn and 98.8% indicated they would recommend this program to other new mothers.

ConclusionEssential Coaching for Every Mother may play a role in increasing maternal self-efficacy and decreasing anxiety, although future work with a control group is needed to delineate the true effects of the program. Overall, mothers were satisfied with the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program and would recommend it for other mothers, during COVID-19 and beyond.",NA,medrxiv

This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and identified factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada, specifically in key priority groups identified by the American Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) for early immunization.

MethodsIndividuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia aged 25-69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Two multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsOf 4,948 respondents, 79.8% intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In multivariable modeling, respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine attitudinal scores (p <0.001), reported greater influence of direct social norms (p = 0.001), and indirect social norms, including their family physician (p = 0.024), and Provincial Health Officer (p = 0.011). Older individuals (>60 years) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine, while females (95%CI 0.57,0.93), those with less than high school education (95%CI 0.5,0.76), those who self-identified as non-white (95%CI 0.60,0.92), self-identified as Indigenous (95%CI 0.36,0.84) and essential non-health care workers (95%CI 0.59,0.86) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsTo optimize vaccine coverage, public health should focus on key messages around vaccine safety and benefit, and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging. As certain key populations identified by NACI and ACIP for early immunization report a lower intention to vaccinate, there is a need for in-depth education and support for these communities to ensure optimal uptake.",10.1186/s12889-021-11098-9,medrxiv

The study uses an agent-based simulation model that replicates community spread in an urban region of U.S.A. via daily social mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the models behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15 %) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.",NA,medrxiv

Thus, new guidelines, highly influenced by pathology, were devised for its diagnosis.

We attempted to study the impact of the 2020 HP guidelines on pathological diagnosis of previously diagnosed cases of IP. Cases with fibrotic IP diagnosed in 2014-2019 were classified according to the 2020 HP guidelines into three categories: typical HP, probable HP, and indeterminate HP. The original pathological diagnosis and categorization based on the HP guidelines were compared. The clinical data including the serum data and the pulmonary function tests were compared among the groups.The study analyzed 247 consecutive cases classified into typical, probable, and indeterminate for HP, and alternative diagnoses. The number of cases that changed from an original diagnosis other than HP to HP based on the guidelines was 56 (23%). The clinical data of these cases bore greater resemblance to cases diagnosed as indeterminate for HP than those cases diagnosed as typical or probable HP. The ratios of typical and probable HP to those of the total cases were significantly low using cryobiopsy.

Thus, with the application of the new guidelines, the pathological diagnosis of HP efficiently excluded HP cases but increased the rate of HP diagnosis for cases with fibrotic IP, which may not fit well to an HP diagnosis.

They are hypothesised to be a key mechanism that generates psychotic symptoms through the production of aberrant attribution of motivational salience and are proposed to result from accumulated childhood adversity and genetic risk, making the striatal system hyper-responsive to stress. However, few studies have examined whether children with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) also exhibit these alterations, limiting our understanding of how differences in reward processing relate to hallucinations and delusional ideation in childhood. Consequently, we examined whether PLEs and PLE-related distress were associated with reward-related activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The sample consisted of children (N = 6,718) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aged 9-10 years who had participated in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task in functional MRI.

We validate both models on an internal held-out cohort from The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on an external independent cohort from The National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC). The deep-learning model is more accurate and significantly faster than the volume/thickness model. The model can also be used to forecast progression: subjects with mild cognitive impairment misclassified as having mild Alzheimers disease dementia by the model were faster to progress to dementia over time. An analysis of the features learned by the proposed model shows that it relies on a wide range of regions associated with Alzheimers disease. These findings suggest that deep neural networks can automatically learn to identify imaging biomarkers that are predictive of Alzheimers disease, and leverage them to achieve accurate early detection of the disease.",NA,medrxiv

Methods and MaterialsClients with pathology-proven lesions (n=3,160) and age-matched controls (n=3,240) were selected from women screened at BreastScreen SA from January 2010 to December 2016 (n clients=207,691) and split into training, validation and test subsets (70%, 15%, 15% respectively). The primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC), in the SA Test Set 1 (SATS1), differentiating invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (n=469) from age-matched controls (n=490) and benign lesions (n=44). The NYU system was tested statically, after training without transfer learning (TL), after retraining with TL and without (NYU1) and with (NYU2) heatmaps.

ResultsThe static NYU1 model AUCs in the NYU test set (NYTS) and SATS1 were 83.0%(95%CI=82.4%-83.6%)(2) and 75.8%(95%CI=72.6%-78.8%), respectively. Static NYU2 AUCs in the NYTS and SATS1 were 88.6%(95%CI=88.3%-88.9%)(2) and 84.5%(95%CI=81.9%-86.8%), respectively. Training of NYU1 and NYU2 without TL achieved AUCs in the SATS1 of 65.8% (95%CI=62.2%-69.1%) and 85.9%(95%CI=83.5%-88.2%), respectively. Retraining of NYU1 and NYU2 with TL resulted in AUCs of 82.4%(95%CI=79.7-84.9%) and 86.3%(95%CI=84.0-88.5%) respectively.

ConclusionWe did not fully reproduce the reported performance of NYU on a local dataset; local retraining with TL approximated this level of performance. Optimising models for local clinical environments may improve performance. The generalisation of DL systems to new environments may be challenging.

Key ContributionsIn this study, the original performance of deep learning models for screening mammography was reduced in an independent clinical population.

Deep learning (DL) systems for mammography require local testing and may benefit from local retraining.

An openly available DL system approximates human performance in an independent dataset.

Pulmonary factors including air trapping contribute to this limitation but the contribution of cardiovascular factors is unclear.

MethodsTo determine contribution of cardiovascular mechanisms to SHS-associated exercise limitation, we examined the cardiovascular responses to maximum effort exercise testing in 166 never-smokers with remote but prolonged occupational exposure to SHS and no known history of cardiovascular disease except nine with medically-controlled hypertension. We estimated the contribution of oxygen-pulse (proxy for cardiac stroke volume) and changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) and heart rate (HR) over workload towards exercise capacity, and examined whether the association of SHS with exercise capacity was mediated through these variables.

ResultsOxygen consumption (VO2Peak) and oxygen-pulse (O2-PulsePeak) at peak exercise were 1,516{+/-}431mL/min (100{+/-}23 %predicted) and 10.6{+/-}2.8mL/beat (117{+/-}25 %predicted), respectively, with 91 (55%) and 43 (26%) of subjects not being able to achieve their maximum predicted values. Sixty-two percent showed hypertensive response to exercise by at least one established criterion. In adjusted models, VO2Peak was associated directly with O2-Pulse and inversely with rise of SBP and DBP over workload (all P<0.05). Moreover, SHS exposure association with VO2Peak was mainly (84%) mediated through its effect on oxygen-pulse (P=0.034). Notably, although not statistically significant, a large proportion (60%) of air trapping effect on VO2Peak seemed to be mediated through oxygen-pulse (P=0.066).

Being employed was associated with gender (male vs. female OR 2.5; 95%CI 1.9-3.2), education (university vs. primary OR 3.7; 2.9-4.7), marital status (married vs. single OR 1.3; 1.04-1.6), and age in a non-linear manner. University (vs primary) education was associated with lower odds of absenteeism (OR 0.7; 0.5-0.96) and presenteeism (OR 0.5; 0.3-0.7). Associations were similar across SpA phenotypes. Higher HCE was associated with more favourable work outcomes, e.g., higher odds of employment (OR 2.5; 1.5-4.1). Gender discrepancy in odds of employment was greater in countries with lower socioeconomic development.

ConclusionHigher educational attainment and higher HCE were associated with more favourable work outcomes, independently of SpA phenotype. The disadvantageous effect of female gender on employment is particularly strong in countries with lower socioeconomic development.",NA,medrxiv

However, its effect on the age of disease onset remains unclear. This study examines the relationship between serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and age of first symptom onset among recently diagnosed MS patients.

MethodSerum 25(OH)D was measured from forty MS patients sampled near disease onset. After correcting seasonal variability, a multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations to age at onset.

ResultsSerum 25(OH)D was not correlated with age at onset (P>0.5). However, CSF IgG index was lower among patients with later disease onset ({beta}=-5.35, P=0.028). Furthermore, we observed bias resulting from non-random distribution of sampling by season, which after correcting indicates a higher 25(OH)D level among patients sampled at relapse compared to remission, instead of lower as previously reported.

ConclusionIn summary, serum 25(OH)D was not associated with the age at onset.",NA,medrxiv

The current study sought to provide insight into the relationship between carbohydrate restriction and glycaemia by testing the effect of varying doses of carbohydrate on continuous glucose concentrations within a range of intakes defined as low-carbohydrate while controlling for confounding factors.

MethodsThis was a randomised crossover trial in participants with T2D testing 5 different 6-day eucaloric, isocaloric dietary treatments with varying carbohydrate contents (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% kcal). Diets were kept isocaloric by exchanging %kcal from carbohydrate with predominantly unsaturated fat, keeping protein constant at 15% kcal. Daily self-weighing was employed to ensure participants maintained their weight throughout each treatment arm. Between dietary treatments, participants underwent a washout period of at least 7 days and were advised to maintain their habitual diet. Glycemic control was assessed using a continuous glucose monitoring device that was placed while the participant was on their normal diet, and was worn for the 6 days of each treatment.

Results12 participants completed the study. There were no differences in 24-hour and postprandial sensor glucose concentrations between the 30%kcal and 10%kcal doses (7.4 {+/-} 1.1mmol/L vs 7.6 {+/-} 1.4mmol/L (P=0.28) and 8.0 {+/-} 1.4mmol/L vs 8.3 {+/-} 1.3mmol/L (P=0.28) respectively). In our exploratory analyses we did not find any dose-response relationship between carbohydrate intake and glycaemia. A small amount of weight loss occurred in each treatment arm (range: 0.4 to 1.1kg over the 6 days) but adjusting for these differences did not influence the primary or secondary outcomes.

ConclusionsModest changes in dietary carbohydrate content in the absence of weight loss while keeping dietary protein intake constant do not appear to influence glucose concentrations in people with T2D.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the concordance of MammaPrint results (70-gene signature) and BluePrint results (80-gene signature) between core needle biopsies (CNB) and surgical resection (SR) specimens using prospectively collected matched tissues from patients enrolled in the FLEX trial (NCT03053193).

MethodsWe analyzed 113 matched CNB and SR tumor specimens from women with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in the FLEX trial. Each patient enrolled in the trial receives a MammaPrint recurrence risk classification test with or without BluePrint molecular subtyping. Concordance of MammaPrint is reported using overall percentage agreement, positive predictive value (PPV, High Risk), negative predictive value (NPV, Low Risk), and Cohens kappa coefficient. Additionally, correlations between sample types are reported using Pearson correlation coefficient.

ResultsWe found good concordance for MammaPrint results between CNB and SR tumor samples (90.3%, {kappa} = 0.803), with a 95.1% NPV and 84.6% PPV. There was also a strong correlation of MammaPrint indices between CNB and SR specimens (r = 0.94). In addition to our primary objective, we determined the concordance of BluePrint subtyping in the matched tumor samples, and found excellent concordance (98.2%) and strong correlation of BluePrint scores within each subtype.

ConclusionCNB samples demonstrated overall high concordance with paired SR samples for MammaPrint risk classification, ensuring that physicians are provided with accurate prognostic information for therapy decisions based on testing of core biopsy tissue. Further, BluePrint molecular subtyping also had good concordance between the sample types, outperforming concordance rates based on traditional IHC based classification. Overall, with an increase in neoadjuvant therapy, physicans and patients can be assured that MammaPrint and BluePrint provide reliable results that guide timely and appropriate therapies using preoperative CNB specimens.",NA,medrxiv

Study designHigh-speed photographic evaluation of aerosol and smoke generated in simulated surgical fields.

Materials and methodsSurgical site aerosol clearance was evaluated using a model of the anterior neck and prototypes for surgical site evacuator ports created using 3D printing. A commercially available electrocautery handpiece fitted with an evacuator was tested on animal tissue for smoke clearance. Both systems were connected to a commercial vacuum powered evacuation system. High speed photography was used to record videos of the aerosols and plumes. Fields were recorded with and without evacuation.

ResultsEfficient aerosol clearance from an open surgical field using an evacuator port is dependent upon the port design, airflow velocity, and placement relative to the aerosol generating site. The size and surface geometry of the surgical field are also important.

Surgical smoke generated with electrocautery is cleared from the field by the evacuation enclosure around the handpiece, even at high electrocautery power settings. Except for device noise, there appears to be no reason for using evacuator flow rates below the maximum setting.

ConclusionsBioaerosol and smoke generated during surgery are potential sources of respiratory pathogens and pose a threat to operating room personnel. Surgical site evacuation can significantly reduce the volume of airborne particles in the field but requires careful design and deployment considerations.x",NA,medrxiv

In these countries the prevalence of diabetes has been rising more rapidly which can lead to various micro-vascular complications thus increasing the risk of dying prematurely.

MethodsA cross-sectional - comparative and hospital-based study was carried out in which OOP expenditure of diabetic patient treating in public and private hospital was compared. A total of 154 diabetic patients i.e.77 in each type of hospitals were selected purposively in consultation with attending physician and staffs. Face to face interview was done to diabetic patient with a minimum of one year of illness using structured questionnaire. Lorentz curve and concentration curve were prepared using income and expenditure of the patients.

ResultAmong154 patients, 97.4% patients had paid out of pocket for the treatment of diabetes. Mean direct cost per month was NRs. 7312.17 in public and NRs. 10125.31 in private hospital. Direct medical cost had higher share in total direct cost i.e. 60.5% in public and 69.3 % in private hospital. Medicine cost had higher percentage share (50.9%) in public hospital and laboratory cost had higher percentage share (68%) in private hospital.

ConclusionDirect medical cost was higher in private hospital as compared to public hospital. All the income groups have to pay similar amount of money for the treatment i.e. economic burden for the treatment of disease was found higher for the poor people as there was not any financial protection mechanism.",NA,medrxiv

Materials and MethodsFifteen reviewers performed a manual chart review for 150 COVID-19 positive patients in the data mart. To support rapid chart review for a wide range of target data, we offered the Digital Analytic Patient Reviewer (DAPR). DAPR is a web-based chart review tool that integrates patient notes and provides note search functionalities and a patient-specific summary view linked with relevant notes. Within DAPR, we developed a COVID-19 validation task-oriented view and information extraction logic, enabled fast access to data, and considered privacy and security issues.

ResultsThe concepts for COVID-19 positive cohort, COVID-19 index date, COVID-19 related admission, and the admission date were shown to have high values in all evaluation metrics. For phenotypes, the overall specificities, PPVs, and NPVs were high. However, sensitivities were relatively low. Based on these results, we removed 3 phenotypes from our data mart.

Study SettingAll encounters paid or provided by VA between January 1, 2019 and February 27, 2021.

Study DesignWe aggregated all VA paid or provided encounters and classified them into community (non-VA) acute and non-acute visits, VA acute and non-acute visits, and VA virtual visits. We then compared the number of encounters by week over time to pre-pandemic levels.

Data Extraction MethodsAggregation of administrative VA claims and health records.

Principal FindingsVA has experienced a dramatic and persistent shift to providing virtual care and purchasing care from non-VA providers. Before the pandemic, a majority (63%) of VA care was provided in-person at a VA facility. One year into the pandemic, in-person care at VAs constituted just 33% of all visits. Most of the difference made up by large expansions of virtual care; total VA provided visits (in person and virtual) declined (4.9 million to 4.2 million) while total visits of all types declined only 3.5%. Community provided visits exceeded prepandemic levels (2.3 million to 2.9 million, +26%).

ConclusionUnlike private health care, VA has resumed in-person care slowly at its own facilities, and more rapidly in purchased care with different financial incentives a likely driver. The very large expansion of virtual care nearly made up the difference. With a widespread physical presence across the U.S., this has important implications for access to care and future allocation of medical personnel, facilities, and resources.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe deployed particulate air samplers in rooms with COVID-19 positive patients in hospital ward and ICU rooms, rooms in long-term care homes experiencing outbreaks, and a correctional facility experiencing an outbreak. Samplers were placed between 2 and 3 meters from the patient. Aerosol (small liquid particles suspended in air) samples were collected onto gelatin filters by Ultrasonic Personal Air Samplers (UPAS) fitted with <2.5{micro}m (micrometer) and <10 {micro}m size-selective inlets operated for 16 hours (total 1.92m3), and with a Coriolis Biosampler over 10 minutes (total 1.5m3). Samples were assayed for viable SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the viral genome by multiplex PCR using the E and N protein target sequences. We validated the sampling methods by inoculating gelatin filters with viable vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and with three concentrations of viable SARS-CoV-2, operating personal samplers for 16hrs, and quantifying viable virus recovery by TCID50 assay.

GX-19 contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and GX-19N contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) foldon and nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

MethodsTwo open-label phase 1 trials of GX-19 and GX-19N safety and immunogenicity were performed in healthy adults aged 19-55 years. GX-19 trial participants received two vaccine injections (1{middle dot}5 mg or 3{middle dot}0 mg, 1:1 ratio) four weeks apart. GX-19N trial participants received two 3{middle dot}0 mg vaccine injections four weeks apart.

FindingsBetween June 17 and July 30 and December 28 and 31, 2020, 40 and 21 participants were enrolled in the GX-19 and GX-19N trials, respectively. Thirty-two participants (52{middle dot}5%) reported 80 treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) after vaccination. All solicited AEs were mild except one case of moderate fatigue reported in the 1{middle dot}5 mg GX-19 group. Binding antibody responses increased after vaccination in all groups. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of spike-binding antibodies on day 57 were 85{middle dot}74, 144{middle dot}20, and 201{middle dot}59 in the 1{middle dot}5 mg, 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19 groups and the 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19N group, respectively. In GX-19N group, neutralizing antibody response (50% neutralizing titer using FRNT) significantly increased after vaccination, but GMT of neutralizing antibody on day 57 (37.26) was lower than those from human convalescent serum (288.78). GX-19N induced stronger T cell responses than GX-19. The magnitude of GX-19N-induced T cell responses was comparable to those observed in the convalescent PBMCs. GX-19N induced both SARS-CoV-2 spike- and NP-specific T cell responses, and the amino acid sequences of 15-mer peptides containing NP-specific T cell epitopes identified in GX-19N-vaccinated participants were identical with those of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants

InterpretationGX-19N is safe, tolerated and induces humoral and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response which may enable cross-reactivity to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Despite the successful clinical efficacy of the approved vaccines, concerns exist regarding emerging new SARS-CoV-2 variants that have mutated receptor binding domains in the spike protein. We searched PubMed for research articles published up to May 1, 2021, using various combinations of the terms ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""vaccine"", and ""clinical trial"". No language or data restrictions were applied. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and World Health Organization (WHO) draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines for ongoing trials of COVID-19 vaccines up to May 1, 2021. Ten DNA-based vaccines, including the vaccine candidate reported here, are in ongoing clinical trials. Among these, safety and immunogenicity results were reported from only one phase 1 trial of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (INO-4800). INO-4800 demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability and was immunogenic, eliciting humoral and/or cellular immune responses in all vaccinated subjects. There is only one ongoing clinical trial of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants (mRNA-1273.351).

Added value of this studyThis is the first-in-human phase 1 trial in healthy adults of a recombinant DNA vaccine for COVID-19 (GX-19N) containing the coding regions of both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins. This trial showed that GX-19N is safe, tolerated, and able to induce both humoral and cellular responses. A two-dose vaccination of 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19N (on days 1 and 29) induced significant humoral and cellular responses. The neutralizing geometric mean titers in individuals vaccinated with GX-19N were lower than those of human convalescent sera. However, the GX-19N group showed increased T cell responses, which was similar to those analyzed using convalescent PBMCs. Furthermore, GX-19N induced not only SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell responses but also broad nucleocapsid-specific T cell responses, which were also specific to SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Implications of all the available evidenceIt is important to note that GX-19N contains a plasmid encoding both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, and that it showed broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, which may allow cross-reactivity with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on these safety and immunogenicity findings, GX-19N was selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials.",NA,medrxiv

We analysed the impact of filtering facepiece class 2 (FFP2) vs. surgical masks on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition among Swiss healthcare workers (HCW).

MethodsOur prospective multicentre cohort enrolled patient-facing HCWs from June to August 2020. Participants were asked about COVID-19 risk exposures/behaviours, including preferred mask type when caring for COVID-19 patients outside of aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). For those performing AGPs, we asked whether they used FFP2 irrespective of the patients COVID-19 status (i.e. universal use). The impact of FFP2 on i) self-reported SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal PCR/rapid antigen tests captured during weekly surveys, and ii) SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion between baseline and January/February 2021 was assessed.

ResultsWe enrolled 3259 participants from nine healthcare institutions, whereof 716 (22%) preferentially used FFP2 respirators. Among these, 81/716 (11%) reported a SARS-CoV-2-positive swab, compared to 352/2543 (14%) surgical mask users (median follow-up 242 days); seroconversion was documented in 85/656 (13%) FFP2 and 426/2255 (19%) surgical mask users. Adjusted for baseline characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and risk behaviour, FFP2 use was non-significantly associated with a decreased risk for SARS-CoV-2-positive swab (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0{middle dot}8, 95% CI 0{middle dot}6-1{middle dot}0, p=0{middle dot}052) and seroconversion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0{middle dot}7, 95% CI 0{middle dot}5-1{middle dot}0, p=0{middle dot}053); household exposure was the strongest risk factor (aHR for positive swab 10{middle dot}1, p<0{middle dot}001; aOR for seroconversion 5{middle dot}0, p<0{middle dot}001). In subgroup analysis, FFP2 use was clearly protective among those with frequent (>20 patients) COVID-19 exposure (aHR 0{middle dot}7, p<0{middle dot}001; aOR 0{middle dot}6, p=0{middle dot}035). Universal FFP2 use during AGPs showed no protective effect (aHR 1{middle dot}1, p=0{middle dot}7; aOR 0{middle dot}9, p=0{middle dot}53).

ConclusionRespirators compared to surgical masks may convey additional protection from SARS-CoV-2 for HCW with frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients.

MethodsCOVID-19 adult outpatients were enrolled within 7 days of symptom onset. Clinical symptoms were recorded via patient diary. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to quantitate SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and for infectious virus isolation in Vero E6-cells. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in serum using a validated ELISA assay.

ResultsAmong 204 participants with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID19, the median nasopharyngeal viral RNA was 6.5 (IQR 4.7-7.6 log10 copies/mL), and 26% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgM, IgG, and/or total Ig) at baseline. Infectious virus was recovered in 7% of participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to 58% of participants without antibodies (probability ratio (PR)=0.12, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.36; p=0.00016). Infectious virus isolation was also associated with higher levels of viral RNA (mean RNA difference +2.6 log10, 95% CI: 2.2, 3.0; p<0.0001) and fewer days since symptom onset (PR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.88 per day; p<0.0001).

ConclusionsThe presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is strongly associated with clearance of infectious virus isolation. Seropositivity and viral RNA levels are likely more reliable markers of infectious virus clearance than subjective measure of COVID-19 symptom duration. Virus-targeted treatment and prevention strategies should be administered as early as possible and ideally before seroconversion.

Key Points (Summary)Among COVID-19 outpatients within 7 days of symptom onset, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was strongly associated with clearance of infectious virus.

We implemented standardized, physiology-based, ICU admission criteria and analyzed the mortality rate of patients refused from the ICU.

Materials and MethodsCOVID-19 patients proposed for ICU admission were consecutively analyzed; Do-not-resuscitate patients were excluded. Patients presenting a SpO2 lower than 85% and/or dyspnea and/or mental confusion resulted eligible for ICU admission; patients not presenting these criteria remained in the ward with an intensive monitoring protocol. Primary outcome was both groups survival rate. Secondary outcome was a sub analysis correlating SpO2 cutoff with ICU admission.

ResultsFrom March 2020 to January 2021, 1623 patients were admitted to our Center; 208 DNR patients were excluded; 97 patients underwent intensivist evaluation. The ICU-admitted group mortality rate resulted 15.9% at 28 days and 27% at 40 days; the ICU-refused group mortality rate resulted 0% at both intervals (p < 0.001). With a SpO2 cut-off of 92%, the hypoxia rate distribution did not correlate with ICU admission (p = 0.26); with a SpO2 cut-off of 85%, a correlation was found (p = 0.009). A similar correlation was also found with dyspnea (p =0.0002).

ConclusionIn COVID-19 patients, standardized ICU admission criteria appeared to reduce safely ICU overload. In the absence of dyspnea and/or confusion, a SpO2 cutoff up to 85% for ICU admission was not burdened by negative outcomes. In a pandemic context, the SpO2 cutoff of 92%, as a threshold for ICU admission, needs critical re-evaluation.",NA,medrxiv

We describe the 12-month experience of the first UK dedicated Post-COVID clinical service to include both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients.

MethodsIn a single-centre, observational analysis, we report outcomes for 1325 individuals assessed in the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Post-COVID service between April 2020 and April 2021. Demography, symptoms, comorbidities, investigations, treatments, functional recovery, specialist referral and rehabilitation were compared by referral route (""post hospitalisation"", PH; ""non-hospitalised"", NH; and ""post emergency department"", PED). Symptoms associated with poor recovery or inability to return to work full-time were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.

Findings1325 individuals were assessed (PH 547 [41.3%], PED 212 [16%], NH 566 [42.7%]. Compared with PH and PED groups, NH were younger (median 44.6 [35.6-52.8] vs 58.3 [47.0-67.7] and 48.5 [39.4-55.7] years), more likely to be female (68.2%, 43.0% and 59.9%), less likely to be from an ethnic minority (30.9%, 52.7% and 41.0%) and seen later after symptom onset (median [IQR]:194 [118-298], 69 [51-111] and 76 [55-128] days) (all p<0.0001). NH patients had similar rates of onward specialist referral as PH and PED groups (18.7%, 16.1% and 18.9%, p=0.452), and were more likely to require support for breathlessness (23.7%, 5.5% and 15.1%, p<0.001) and fatigue (17.8%, 4.8%, 8.0%, p<0.001). Hospitalised patients had higher rates of pulmonary emboli, persistent lung interstitial abnormalities, and other organ impairment. 716 (54.0%) individuals reported <75% of optimal health (median [IQR] 70% [55%-85%]). Overall, less than half of employed individuals felt able to return to work full-time at first assessment.

InterpretationSymptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection were significant in both post- and non-hospitalised patients, with significant ongoing healthcare needs and utilisation. Trials of interventions and patient-centred pathways for diagnostic and treatment approaches are urgently required.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSPrevious evidenceC_ST_ABSLong COVID and post-COVID syndrome were first identified in April 2020. We searched PubMed and medrxiv for articles published up to April 30th, 2021, using the keywords ""long COVID"", ""post-COVID syndrome"", ""persistent symptoms"", ""hospitalised"", ""community"" and ""non-hospitalised"". We identified 17 articles and 7 systematic reviews. Fifteen studies have considered symptoms, multi-organ or functional impairment but only one study to-date has considered all these variables in non-hospitalised COVID patients. No studies have compared symptom burden and management between non-hospitalised and hospitalised individuals as systematically assessed and managed in a dedicated post-COVID service.

Added value of this studyFor the first time, we report the baseline characteristics, investigation and outcomes of initial assessment of all eligible patients in a dedicated multi-professional post-COVID service, including 547 post-hospitalisation, 566 non-hospitalised and 212 patients discharged from emergency department. Despite relatively low comorbidity and risk factor burden in non-hospitalised patients, we show that both non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients presenting with persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV2 infection have high rates of functional impairment, specialist referral and rehabilitation, even 6-12 months after the acute infection. These real-world data will inform models of care during and beyond the pandemic.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe significant, long-lasting health and social consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not confined to those who required hospitalisation. As with other long-term conditions, care of patients experiencing Long COVID or specific end-organ effects require consistent, integrated, patient-centred approaches to investigation and management. At public health and policy level, burden of post-COVID morbidity demands renewed focus on effective infection suppression for all age groups.",NA,medrxiv

ParticipantsIn the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), n = 10,109 participants aged 50-89 years were assessed at wave 1 (baseline: 2002-03) and followed-up over 16 years to wave 9 (2017-18).

MethodsVerbal memory was assessed biennially by tests of immediate and delayed word-recall. Positive and negative aspects of perceived relationship quality (social support and strain, respectively) were measured by relationship type (spouse; children; extended family members; friends). Random effects within-between (REWB) modelling was used to separate between- and within-person effects. Associations were estimated between levels of social support/strain and (i) baseline levels of memory (main effects), and (ii) the 2-year decline in memory (interaction with time).

ResultsLongitudinal associations were most prominent for men, specific to relationship type, and showed between-rather than within-person effects. Among men, higher spousal strain was associated with faster decline in memory ({beta}between-effectxtime = -0.043; 95% CI: -0.084, -0.002; p = 0.039), whilst greater support from children was associated with slower decline ({beta}between-effectxtime = 0.020; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.039; p = 0.033). Men with higher levels of strain from friends had lower baseline memory ({beta}between-effect = -0.382; 95% CI: -0.627, -0.137; p = 0.002) and showed faster decline ({beta}between-effectxtime = -0.047; 95% CI: -0.095, 0.000; p = 0.051).

ConclusionsDifferences between persons in levels of social support and social strain were modestly associated with the rate of memory decline, especially among men.

Screening programmes have attempted to reduce the mortality from BO associated oesophageal adenocarcinoma but cannot predict which BO patients will progress to invasive malignancy. We have previously identified the long non coding RNA, OR3A4, is differentially hypomethylated in progressive BO. We aimed to understand its role in BO pathogenicity

MethodsThe stable BO cell line CP-A, as well as the oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells line OE-33 was transfected with a lentiviral OR3A4 over-expression vector, and underwent high resolution microscopy, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, RNA sequencing, and targeted drug screening with the p38-MAPK inhibitor domipramod to understand the effects of OR3A4 expression on progression. We then compared progressive vs. non-progressive BO samples using quantitative multi-fluorophore (Vectra) immunohistochemistry.

ResultsOver-expression of OR3A4 in CP-A lines resulted in a hyperproliferative, dysplastic cellular phenotype, with strong over-expression of MAPK and anti-apoptotic pathways at the RNA and protein level, which was sensitive to the p38-MAPK inhibitor domipramod. Vectra immunohistochemistry demonstrated that progressive BO had reduced visibility associated with a reduction in CD8+ T-cells and CD68+ macrophages and reduced CD4+ T-cells in the stomal compartment.

ConclusionThe overexpression of OR3A4, which we have previously shown is associated with progressive BO leads to a proliferative dysplastic cellular phenotype associated with increased, reversible MAPK signalling and loss of immune visibility.",NA,medrxiv

Health systems are also limited in their ability to assess how well their palliative care services reach the population in need, which in turn makes it much more difficult to determine the quality, value, and effectiveness of those services. This study describes the creation, validation, and operationalization of an electronic registry of patients potentially eligible for palliative care at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, US.

ResultsThe electronic palliative care eligibility algorithm performed well within the chart review validation sample, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.903 and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.545. Within the 2.4 million individuals who contacted the SH electronic health record (EHR) during 2017, the final algorithm identified 1.1%-1.8% of patients (26,773-42,847) as potentially eligible for palliative care services. This included approximately 12.9%-17.7% of inpatients (16,392-22,507 out of 126,916), and 1.2%-1.9% of ambulatory care patients (20,140-32,212 out of 1.7 million).

However, our inability to accurately measure respiratory rate in hospitalised infants results in unreported episodes of apnoea and an incomplete picture of respiratory dynamics.

MethodsWe develop, validate and use a novel algorithm to identify inter-breath intervals (IBIs) and apnoeas in infants. In 42 infants (a total of 1600 hours of recordings) we assess IBIs from the chest electrical impedance pneumograph using an adaptive amplitude threshold for the detection of individual breaths. The algorithm is refined by comparing its accuracy with clinically-observed breaths and pauses in breathing. We also develop an automated classifier to differentiate periods of true central apnoea from artefactually low amplitude signal. We use this algorithm to explore its ability to identify morphine-induced respiratory depression in 15 infants. Finally, in 22 infants we use the algorithm to investigate whether retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening alters the IBI distribution.

Findings88% of the central apnoeas identified using our algorithm were missed in the clinical notes. As expected, morphine caused a shift in the IBI distribution towards longer IBIs, with significant differences in all IBI metrics assessed. Following ROP screening, there was a shift in the IBI distribution with a significant increase in the proportion of pauses in breathing that lasted more than 10 seconds (t-statistic=1.82, p=0.023). This was not reflected by changes in the monitor-derived respiratory rate or episodes of apnoea recorded on clinical charts.

InterpretationBetter measurement of infant respiratory dynamics is essential to improve care for hospitalised infants. Use of the novel IBI algorithm demonstrates that following ROP screening increased instability in respiratory dynamics can be detected in the absence of clinically-significant apnoeas.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSRespiratory disorders are one of the most common reasons for admission to a neonatal care unit and many pathologies and clinically-required procedures affect respiration. Despite this, current methods to measure respiratory rate in infants often provide inaccurate measurements due to factors such as poor electrode placement, movement artefact and cardiac interference. Lee and colleagues previously developed an algorithm to better identify episodes of apnoea in infants from the electrical impedance pneumograph following removal of cardiac-frequency interference. This algorithm substantially improves apnoea detection and demonstrates the high number of apnoeas that are missed in medical records. However, false apnoeas can be detected during periods of low amplitude signal caused by shallow breathing or poor electrode placement, and shorter inter-breath intervals (IBIs) cannot be assessed using the method proposed by Lee et al. limiting its use in assessing more subtle changes in an infants respiratory dynamics.

Added value of this studyWe develop, test and use a new algorithm for the identification of IBIs from the electrical impedance pneumograph. We use an adaptive amplitude threshold for the identification of breaths and develop a classification model to remove periods of low amplitude signal falsely identified as episodes of apnoea. Using the algorithm, we demonstrate that retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening causes a significant increase in pauses in breathing that last more than 10 seconds. Our apnoea detection method was more sensitive than the current standard monitor-derived approach that is used to monitor respiratory rate in neonatal care units.

Implications of all the available evidenceTo improve understanding of infant respiratory dynamics, better methods of assessment are essential. This will create a more complete clinical understanding of infant well-being, that will lead to improved treatment options for infants with respiratory disorders.",NA,medrxiv

Despite high fatality, the aetiology and pathophysiology of kwashiorkor remain enigmatic, including the role of serum albumin on oedema development. Here, we demonstrate that serum albumin is associated with the presence and severity of oedema among severely malnourished children. Further, in two independent cohorts of children in Malawi and Kenya, we show albumin-independent mechanisms are associated with oedema in SM, including oxidative stress and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Plasma concentrations of ECM-related proteins: lumican, podoplanin, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 were associated with kwashiorkor. We therefore conclude that the pathophysiology of kwashiorkor has both albumin-dependent and independent mechanisms. We discuss the ways in which albumin-independent mechanisms may explain the clinical features observed in kwashiorkor.",NA,medrxiv

Preadolescent suicidality is a major health problem with rising rates, yet its underlying biology is understudied. Here we studied effects of genetic stress susceptibility, estimated by polygenic risk score (PRS) for post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD), on preadolescent suicidality in participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R). We further evaluated PTSD-PRS effects on suicidality in the presence of environmental stressors that are established suicide risk factors. Analyses included both European and African ancestry participants using PRS calculated based on summary statistics from ancestry-specific genome-wide association studies. In European ancestry participants (N=4,619, n=378 suicidal), PTSD-PRS was associated with preadolescent suicidality (odds ratio [OR]=1.12, 95%CI 1-1.25, p=0.038). Results in African ancestry participants (N=1,334, n=130 suicidal) showed a similar direction but were not statistically significant (OR=1.21, 95%CI 0.93-1.57, p=0.153). Sensitivity analyses using non-psychiatric polygenic score for height and using cross-ancestry PTSD-PRS did not reveal any association with suicidality, supporting the specificity of the association of ancestry-specific PTSD-PRS with suicidality. Environmental stressors were robustly associated with suicidality across ancestries with moderate effect size for negative life events and family conflict (OR 1.27-1.6); and with large effect size (OR [~] 4) for sexual-orientation discrimination. When combined with environmental factors, PTSD-PRS showed marginal additive effects in explaining variability in suicidality, with no evidence for G X E interaction. Results support use of cross-phenotype PRS, specifically stress-susceptibility, as a robust genetic marker for suicidality risk early in the lifespan.",NA,medrxiv

Here we describe updates to the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator) to account for immune trajectories over time, correlates of protection, co-circulation of different variants and the roll-out of multiple vaccines. We have extended recent work on neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) as a correlate of protection to account for protection against infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe disease using a joint estimation approach. We find that NAbs are strongly correlated with infection blocking and that natural infection provides stronger protection than vaccination for the same level of NAbs, though vaccines typically produce higher NAbs. We find only relatively weak correlations between NAbs and the probability of developing symptoms given a breakthrough infection, or the probability of severe disease given symptoms. A more refined understanding of breakthrough infections in individuals with natural and vaccine-derived immunity will have implications for timing of booster vaccines, the impact of emerging variants of concern on critical vaccination thresholds, and the need for ongoing non-pharmaceutical interventions.",NA,medrxiv

ObjectiveTo describe the quality of cytopathological exams performed at a family health unit in Salvador - Bahia during the years 2015 and 2016.

MethodA cross-sectional study, of an exploratory descriptive character, was conducted, using a database from a previous study carried out in a health unit in Salvador / BA and approved by the Ethical Committee from State University of Feira de Santana.

ResultsPreventive gynecological exams of 1,350 women were analyzed, but 330 (24.4%) of them could not be evaluated due to the absence of the report in the health unit and the presence of acellular or hypocellular material that prevented the analysis. From 1020 exams, 45 (3.3%) presented an unsatisfactory sample, without conditions for analysis, while 589 (43.19%) showed only squamous cells. From 392 (29.0%) reports with an adequate study sample, 150 (%) were women with a mean age of 38.49 years. These were located and composed the final sample of the present investigation.

Final ConsiderationsWe suggest the need for investments in continuing education for professionals involved in performing cytopathological exams, in order to ensure the right of women to comprehensive and quality health care.",NA,medrxiv

The CNN models were trained with a combination of three large scale databases: ChestX-ray14, CheXpert and PadChest. The final database contained 327,176 images labeled with findings obtained by natural language processing (NLP) techniques applied to the radiology reports. The dataset was split in 16 different balanced binary partitions, which were used to train 16 finding-specific classification CNNs. Afterwards, a normal vs abnormal partition of the dataset was created, being abnormal the presence of at least one pathologic change. This final partition was used to train a fully connected neural network as referee that was fed with all the 16 previously trained outcomes. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis evaluated and compared the performance of the models. The system was successfully implemented and evaluated with a test set of 3400 images. The AUC of the normal vs abnormal classification was 0.94. The highest AUC of the finding-specific classifiers was 0.99 for hernia.

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and impact of AKI in subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 in two third- level hospitals in Cordoba, Argentina.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted. 448 adults who were consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19 between March and the end of October 2020 at Hospital Privado Universitario de Cordoba and Hospital Raul Angel Ferreyra were included. The incidence of AKI was 19% (n = 85). 50.6% presented AKI stage 1 (n=43), 20% stage 2 (n=17) and 29.4% stage 3 (n=25, of which 18 required renal replacement therapy). In the multivariate analysis, the variables that were independently associated with AKI were: age (adjusted Odd ratio -aOR- =1.30, 95%CI=1.04-1.63, p=0.022), history of chronic kidney disease (aOR=9.92, 95%CI=4.52-21.77, p<0.001), blood neutrophil count at admission (aOR=1.09, 95%CI=1.01-1.18, p=0.037) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV) (aOR=6.69, 95%CI=2.24-19.9, p=0.001).

These include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis, infertility, and pregnancy-related disorders. However, the roles and mechanisms of obesity in the aetiology of reproductive disorders remain unclear.

Methods and FindingsWe estimated observational and genetically predicted causal associations between obesity, metabolic hormones, and female reproductive conditions using logistic regression, generalised additive models, and Mendelian randomisation (two-sample, non-linear, and multivariable) applied to data from UK Biobank and publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) were observationally (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.02 - 1.87 per 1 S.D. obesity trait) and causally (ORs = 1.06 - 2.09) associated with uterine fibroids (UF), PCOS, heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), and pre-eclampsia. Causal effect estimates of WHR and WHRadjBMI, but not BMI, were attenuated compared to their observational counterparts. Genetically predicted visceral adipose tissue mass was causal for the development of HMB, PCOS, and pre-eclampsia (ORs = 1.01 - 3.38). Increased waist circumference also posed a higher causal risk (ORs = 1.16 - 1.93) for the development of these disorders and UF than did increased hip circumference (ORs = 1.06 - 1.10). Leptin, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance each mediated between 20% -50% of the total causal effect of obesity on pre-eclampsia. Reproductive conditions clustered based on shared genetic components of their aetiological relationships with obesity.

ConclusionsIn this first systematic, large-scale, genetics-based analysis of the aetiological relationships between obesity and female reproductive conditions, we found that common indices of overall and central obesity increased risk of reproductive disorders to heterogenous extents, mediated by metabolic hormones. Our results suggest exploring the mechanisms mediating the causal effects of overweight and obesity on gynaecological health to identify targets for disease prevention and treatment.",NA,medrxiv

Receiving a score for most PSIs requires a minimum number of qualifying cases, which are partly determined by whether the associated diagnosis-related group (DRG) was surgical and whether the surgery was elective. While these criteria can exempt hospitals from PSIs, it remains to be seen whether exemption is driven by low volume, small numbers of DRGs, or perhaps, policies that determine how procedures are classified as elective.

MethodsUsing Medicare inpatient claims data from 4,069 hospitals between 2015 and 2017, we examined how percentages of elective procedures relate to numbers of surgical claims and surgical DRGs. We used a combination of quantile regression and machine learning based anomaly detection to characterize these relationships and identify outliers. We then used a set of machine learning algorithms to test whether outliers were explained by the DRGs they reported.

ResultsAverage percentages of elective procedures generally decreased from 100% to 60% in relation to the number of surgical claims and the number of DRGs among them. Some providers with high volumes of claims had anomalously low percentages of elective procedures (5% - 40%). These low elective outliers were not explained by the particular surgical DRGs among their claims. However, among hospitals exempted from PSIs, those with the greatest volume of claims were always low elective outliers.

ConclusionSome hospitals with relatively high numbers of surgical claims may have classified procedures as non-elective in a way that ultimately exempted them from certain PSIs.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe used publicly available large datasets to explore differences by country for Covid-19 mortality statistics. We continuously challenged our projections with reality and numbers from countries around the world, allowing us to refine our models and better understand the progression of the epidemic. All our predictions and findings were discussed and validated from a clinical viewpoint.

ResultsWhile no lockdown resulted in higher mortality, the difference between strict lockdown and lax lockdown was not terribly different and favored lax lockdown. Only one of the top 44 countries had long and strict restrictions. Strict restrictions were more common in the worst performing countries in terms of Covid mortality. The United States had both the largest economic growth coupled with the largest rate of mortality. Those who did well economically, had lower mortality and less pressure on their population. Yet they had less mortality than average and less than their neighbors.

ConclusionsCountries with the least restrictions fared best economically. Some of them fared well in terms of mortality, even better than neighboring countries with similar social structures and more severe restrictions. The mortality rates in the USA, however, appeared to suffer from very high obesity rates. Norway and the northern European countries have less strict restrictions from the rest of Europe and had lower mortality rates. COVID-19 mortality was associated with vitamin D status.",NA,medrxiv

Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, only combining the Charlson comorbidity index (AUROC 0.80) or APACHE II (AUROC 0.81) with the IMX-SEV-2 significantly improved prediction of adverse clinical outcomes, and combining with the Charlson comorbidity index for predicting 30-day mortality (AUROC 0.79).

ConclusionsThe IMX-SEV-2 severity score was superior at predicting secondary infections and overall adverse clinical outcomes versus other common metrics. Importantly, combining a rapidly measured transcriptomic metric with clinical or physiologic indices has sufficient precision to optimize resource utilization and allow adjustments to patient management that may improve outcomes in surgical sepsis. Hospitalized patients who are septic and present with an elevated IMX-SEV2 severity score and pre-existing comorbidities would be strong candidates for clinical interventions aimed at reducing the risk of secondary infections and adverse clinical outcomes.",NA,medrxiv

Although the scar prevents cardiac rupture, an excessive profibrotic response impairs optimal recovery.

ObjectiveTo explore the regulation of fibroblasts proliferation through a paracrine action of cardiac stromal cells post-MI

MethodsWe carried out a bioinformatic secretome analysis of cardiac stromal PW1+ cells isolated from normal and post-MI mouse hearts to identify novel secreted proteins. Functional assays were used to screen secreted proteins that promote fibroblast proliferation. The expressions of secreted proteins candidates were subsequently analyzed in mouse and human hearts and plasmas. The relation between levels of circulating protein candidates and adverse post-MI cardiac remodeling was examined in a cohort of 80 patients with a first ST-elevation MI and serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations.

ResultsCardiac stromal PW1+ cells undergo a change in paracrine behavior post-MI and secrete factors that promote fibroblast proliferation. Among these factors, growth differentiation factor 3 (GDF3), a member of the transforming growth factor-{beta} family, was markedly upregulated in the ischemic hearts and induced fibroblast proliferation at high level. In humans, GDF3 was detected in the plasma at day 4 post-MI and GDF3 circulating levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse remodeling 6-month post-MI (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.76 [1.03 - 3.00], p = 0.037).

ConclusionsOur findings define a mechanism for the pro-fibrotic action of cardiac stromal cells through secreted cardiokines, such as GDF3, a candidate marker of adverse fibrotic remodeling following MI.",NA,medrxiv

The few existing long-term studies have indicated no difference in HTx outcomes between patients [&ge;]70 years and 60-69 years age, but these studies only assessed to 5-years post-transplant and included data from the 1980-90s, introducing significant variance due to poorer outcomes in that era. We analyzed the UNOS database from 1987-2020, stratified by timeframe at 2000, to derive a more representative comparison of modern HTx survival outcomes.

MethodsAll UNOS HTx recipients over 18 years of age (n=66,186) were divided into 3 cohorts: 18-59, 60-69 and [&ge;]70 years old. Demographic data as well as perioperative factors were evaluated for significance using Chi-Squared and H-Tests as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier Curve and cox regressions with log-rank tests were used to assess 5 through 10 year survival outcomes.

However, in some parts of Indonesia, including East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP), this adherence is not achieved for a range of reasons including delays in visiting health centres. This study aims to determine factors related to the poor understanding of appropriate malaria treatment-seeking behaviour (AMTSB) of rural adults in ENTP. AMTSB was defined as seeking treatment at professional health facilities within 24 hours of the onset of malaria symptoms.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in the East Sumba, Belu, and East Manggarai district of ENTP between October and December 2019. A multi-stage cluster sampling procedure was applied to enrol 1495 participants aged between 18 and 89 years old. Data were collected through face-to-face interview. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess significant factors associated with the poor understanding of AMTSB.

Results86% of participants were found to be familiar with the term malaria. However, poor understanding level of AMTSB in rural adults of ENTP achieved 60.4% with a 95% confidence interval (CI): 56.9 - 63.8. The most important factors associated with the poor understanding were lower levels of education, low socio-economic status (SES), occupation, and distance to the nearest health facilities. The poor understanding of AMTSB was significantly higher for adults with no education (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.42, 95% CI: 1.81, 6.48); having low SES (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.96); residing three km away from the nearest health facilities (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.5); and working as housewife (AOR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.01 - 2.63). Ethnicity, and family size were not associated with the poor understanding of AMTSB.

ConclusionThe proportion of rural adults having a poor understanding of AMTSB was high leading to ineffective implementation of artemisinin-based combination therapies as the method to treat malaria in ENTP. Improving awareness of AMTSB for rural adults having low-level education, low SES, working as a housewife, and living three km from the nearest health facilities is critical to support the efficacy of malaria treatment in ENTP, as well as to advance the Indonesian governments objective to achieve malaria elimination by 2030.",NA,medrxiv

Although wastewaters can also be used for tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the population level, the reliability of this approach remains to be established, especially for early warning of outbreaks.

MethodsWe collected 377 samples from different treatment plants processing wastewaters of >1 million inhabitants in Valencia, Spain, between April 2020 and March 2021. Samples were cleaned, concentrated, and subjected to RT-qPCR to determine SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. These data were compared with cumulative disease notification rates over 7 and 14 day periods.

ResultsWe amplified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 75% of the RT-qPCRs, with an estimated detection limit of 100 viral genome copies per liter (gc/L). SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration correlated strongly with disease notification rates over 14-day periods (Pearson r = 0.962, P < 0.001). A concentration >1000 gc/L showed >95% sensitivity and specificity as an indicator of more than 25 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Albeit with slightly higher uncertainty, these figures were reproduced using a 7-day period. Time series were similar for wastewaters data and declared cases, but wastewater RNA concentrations exhibited transient peaks that were not observed in declared cases and preceded major outbreaks by several weeks.

InterpretationWastewater analysis provides a reliable tool for monitoring COVID-19, particularly at low incidence values, and is not biased by asymptomatic cases. Moreover, this approach might reveal previously unrecognized features of COVID-19 transmission.

Environmental adversity is key in youth suicidality, hence there is a need to study stressors that disproportionately impact Black youths. We aimed to disentangle the unique contribution of racial/ethnic discrimination from other adversities associated with childhood suicidal ideation and attempts (suicidality) across races.

MethodWe analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R) that included a large, diverse sample of US children (N=11,235, mean age 10.9 years, 20.2% Black) phenotyped for environmental adversities including discrimination. Multivariate regression models tested the association of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination with suicidality, covarying for multiple confounders including other discrimination types (towards non-US born individuals; sexual orientation-based; weight-based). Matched analyses contrasted effects of racial/ethnic discrimination and racial identity on suicidality.

ResultsBlack youths reported more discrimination and higher suicidality rates than non-Black youths. High racial/ethnic discrimination was positively associated with suicidality, adjusting for other discrimination types (odds ratio [OR]=2.6, 95%CI=2.1-3.2). Findings remained significant after adjusting for multiple suicidality risk factors. Once experienced, racial/ethnic discrimination was similarly associated with suicidality in White, Black, and Hispanic youths. Matched analyses revealed that racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with suicidality (relative risk [RR]=2.7, 95%CI=2-3.5), while Black race was not (RR=0.9, 95%CI=0.7-1.2).

ConclusionRacial/ethnic discrimination is disproportionately experienced by Black children, and is associated with preadolescent suicidality, over and above other adversities. Findings highlight the need to address discrimination as part of suicide prevention strategies. Cross-sectional design hampers causal inferences.",NA,medrxiv

Despite a role of genetic factors was proven, the specific underpinnings are not fully understood yet. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which summarise the additive effect of multiple risk variants across the genome, might provide insights into the underlying genetics. This study aims to investigate the possible association of PRSs for bipolar disorder, MDD, neuroticism, and schizophrenia (SCZ) with antidepressant non-response or non-remission in patients with MDD. PRSs were calculated at eight genome-wide P-thresholds based on publicly available summary statistics of the largest genome-wide association studies. Logistic regressions were performed between PRSs and non-response or non-remission in six European clinical samples, adjusting for age, sex, baseline symptom severity, recruitment sites, and population stratification. Results were meta-analysed across samples, including up to 3,637 individuals. Bonferroni correction was applied. In the meta-analysis, no result was significant after Bonferroni correction. The top result was found for MDD-PRS and non-remission (p=0.004), with patients in the highest vs. lowest PRS quintile being more likely not to achieve remission (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.11-1.98, p=0.007). Nominal associations were also found between MDD-PRS and non-response (p=0.013), as well as between SCZ-PRS and non-remission (p=0.035).

The current study summarizes findings from over 2,000 individuals with ASD who received genetic testing, including microarray and exome testing, through the Simons Simplex Consortium. A returnable genetic result is identified in 10% of cases, however, this yield increases based on four readily accessible phenotypes: female sex and the presence of intellectual disability, seizures or delayed walking. Combinations of these factors increase return rate further, with some combinations yielding a return rate over 50%. In conclusion, these four phenotypes provide a simple approach to prioritize genetic testing in a clinical setting and inform future clinical guidelines.

J.; Funk, S.",Alexis Robert,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,2021-06-01,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,cc_by,infectious diseases,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/01/2021.05.31.21257977.source.xml,"BackgroundDespite high levels of vaccine coverage, sub-national heterogeneity in immunity to measles can create pockets of susceptibility, which are hard to detect and may result in long-lasting outbreaks. The elimination status defined by the World Health Organization aims to identify countries where the virus is no longer circulating and can be verified after 36 months of interrupted transmission. However, since 2018, numerous countries have lost their elimination status soon after reaching it, showing that the indicators used to define elimination may not be predictive of lower risks of outbreaks.

Methods and FindingsWe quantified the impact of local vaccine coverage and recent levels of incidence on the dynamics of measles in each French department between 2009 and 2018, using mathematical models based on the  Epidemic-Endemic regression framework. High values of local vaccine coverage were associated with fewer imported cases and lower risks of local transmissions. Regions that had recently reported high levels of incidence were also at a lower risk of local transmission, potentially due to additional immunity accumulated during these recent outbreaks. Therefore, all else being equal, the risk of local transmission was not lower in areas fulfilling the elimination criteria (i.e., low recent incidence). After fitting the models using daily case counts, we used the parameters estimates to simulate the effect of variations in the vaccine coverage and recent incidence on future transmission. A decrease of 3% in the three-year average vaccine uptake led to a five-fold increase in the number of cases simulated in a year on average.

ConclusionsSpatiotemporal variation in vaccine coverage because of disruption of routine immunisation programmes, or lower trust in vaccines, can lead to large increases in both local and cross regional transmission. The association found between local vaccine coverage and incidence suggests that, although regional vaccine uptake can be hard to collect and unreliable because of population movements, it can provide insights into the risks of imminent outbreak. Periods of low local measles incidence were not indicative of a decrease in the risks of local transmission. Therefore, the incidence indicator used to define the elimination status was not consistently associated with lower risks of measles outbreak in France. More detailed models of local immunity levels or subnational seroprevalence studies may yield better estimates of local risk of measles outbreaks.",NA,medrxiv

Assembly election in four states and a union territory of India was taken place during March-May 2021 when the Covid-19 second wave was close to its peak and affected a huge number of people. We studied the impact of assembly election on the effective contact rate and the effective reproduction number of Covid-19 using different epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, and SEIR. We also modeled the effective reproduction number for all election-bound states using different mathematical functions. We separately studied the case of all election-bound states and found all the states shown a distinct increase in the effective contact rate and the effective reproduction number during the election-bound time and just after that compared to pre-election time. States, where elections were conducted in single-phase, showed less increase in the effective contact rate and the reproduction number. The election commission imposed extra measures from the first week of April 2021 to restrict big campaign rallies, meetings, and different political activities. The effective contact rate and the reproduction number showed a trend to decrease for few states due to the imposition of the restrictions. We also compared the effective contact rate, and the effective reproduction number of all election-bound states and the rest of India and found all the parameters related to the spread of virus for election-bound states are distinctly high compared to the rest of India.",NA,medrxiv

Analysis of the 1958 and 1970 British birth cohorts.,"Gondek, D.; Patalay, P.; Blanchflower, D.

The main objective of this study is to investigate distributional shifts underlying observed age and cohort differences in mean levels of psychological distress in the 1958 and 1970 British birth cohorts. Further, we examine whether observed distributional shifts are driven by specific socio-demographic subgroups, according to gender, parental social class at birth, and highest achieved qualification by age 30/33. Finally, we compare cohort and age differences in the distribution of individual symptoms of psychological distress.

MethodsThis study used data from the 1958 National Child Development Study and 1970 British birth cohort. Our analytical sample (n=24,707) included those who had at least one measure of distress, were still alive and were not permanent emigrants from Britain by age 50 in the 1958 birth cohort (n=13,250) and by age 46-48 in the 1970 birth cohort (n=11,457). Psychological distress was measured by the Malaise Inventory at ages 23, 33, 42 and 50 in the 1958 cohort and 26, 34, 42 and 46-48 in the 1970 cohort.

ResultsThe shifts in the distribution across age appear to be mainly due to changing proportion of those with moderate symptoms, except for midlife (age 42-50) when we observed polarisation in distress - increased proportions of people with no or multiple symptoms. The elevated levels of distress in the 1970 cohort, compared with the 1958 cohort, appeared to be due to an increase in the proportion of individuals with both moderate and high symptoms. For instance, at age 33/34 34.2% experienced no symptoms in 1970 compared with 54.0% in the 1958 cohort, whereas 42.3% endorsed at least two symptoms in the 1970 cohort vs 24.7% in 1958. These observed shifts were driven to some extent by a larger proportion of men and individuals with high qualification in the moderate and high distress groups in the more recent cohort. Fatigue, nervousness, and tension were particularly prevalent in this life phase and all examined symptoms were more prevalent in the younger cohort.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the importance of studying not only mean levels of distress over time, but also the underlying shifts in its distribution. Due to the large dispersion of distress scores at any given measurement occasion, understanding the underlying distribution provides a more complete picture of population trends.",NA,medrxiv

It subsequently spread to other countries in the region. The objective of this study is to analyze the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 in West Africa from the first reported case to 31 January 2021.

MethodWe publicly used available data from reliable sources and from the ""COVID-19R"" package. We used epidemic curves to describe the trends in the daily evolution of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in West Africa and specifically in the five countries. The reproduction rate and evolution rates were calculated from these trends.

ResultsAs of 31 January 2021, West Africa had 342,938 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 4,496 deaths. Nigeria had 131,242 cases with 1,586 deaths. Senegal had 26,523 cases with 628 deaths. The case-fatality rate in Mali was 4.08% and the attack rate in Cape Verde was 2587 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania and Mali, the epidemic curves supported by the evolution rates showed an increase in confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 during December 2020 and January 2021 compared to the last two months. The effective reproduction rates (Re) inferred a slowdown in virus transmission (Re < 1) in these countries except for Senegal.

ConclusionThe results showed that COVID-19 was still circulating in some West African countries in late 2020 and early 2021. By improving the health system and with context-specific public health interventions and vaccination, these countries should effectively control COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

J.; Reicher, S. D.",Alex de Figueiredo,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,2021-06-01,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,cc_by_nd,health policy,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/01/2021.05.31.21258122.source.xml,"BackgroundFour vaccines against the novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have currently been approved for use in the United Kingdom. As of 30 April 2021, over 34 million adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The UK Government is considering the introduction of vaccine passports for domestic use and to facilitate international travel for UK residents. Although vaccine incentivisation has been cited as a motivating factor for vaccine passports, it is currently unclear whether vaccine passports are likely to increase inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine.

MethodsWe conducted a large-scale national survey in the UK of 17,611 adults between 9 and 27 April 2021. Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification is used to provide unbiased national-level estimates of the impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines among all respondents who have not yet had two vaccination doses. Multilevel regressions identify the differential impact of the likely impact of vaccine passports on uptake intent between socio-demographic groups. Gibbs sampling was used for Bayesian model inference, with 95% highest posterior density intervals used to capture uncertainty in all parameter estimates.

FindingsWe find that the introduction of vaccine passports will likely lower inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once baseline vaccination intent has been adjusted for. Notably, this decrease is larger if passports were required for domestic use rather than for facilitating international travel. The impact of passports while controlling for baseline vaccination intent differentially impacts individuals by socio-demographic status, with being male (OR 0{middle dot}87, 0{middle dot}76 to 0{middle dot}99) and having degree qualifications (OR 0{middle dot}84, 0{middle dot}72 to 0{middle dot}94) associated with a decreased inclination to vaccinate if passports were required for domestic use, while Christians (OR 1{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}08 to 1{middle dot}41) have an increased inclination over atheists or agnostics. There is a strong association between change in vaccination inclination if passports were introduced and baseline vaccination intent: stated change in vaccination inclination is thus lower among Black or Black British respondents (compared to Whites), younger age groups, and non-English speakers. We find notable sub-national trends, for example, that passports could increase inclination among students and Jewish respondents in London compared to those in full-time education or atheists or agnostics, respectively.

InterpretationTo our knowledge, this is the first quantitative assessment of the potential impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on COVID-19 vaccine intention. Our findings should be interpreted in light of sub-national trends in current uptake rates across the UK, as our results suggest that vaccine passports may induce a lower vaccination inclination in socio-demographic groups that cluster geographically in large urban areas. Caution should therefore be exercised in introducing passports as they may result in less positive health-seeking behaviours for the COVID-19 vaccine (as well as other existing or future vaccinations) and may contribute to concentrated areas of low vaccinate uptake, which is an epidemic risk. We call for further evidence on the impact of vaccine certification on confidence in COVID-19 vaccines and in routine immunisations in wider global settings and, in particular, in countries with low overall trust in vaccinations or in authorities that administer or recommend vaccines.

FundingThis survey was funded by the Merck Investigator Studies Program (MISP)

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSProof of vaccination has, to date, had limited use in public and private settings for the UK public, such as proof of yellow fever vaccination for international travel to limited destinations, or requirements of Hepatitis B vaccination in some medical roles. Although recent surveys have suggested that the majority of the British public support vaccine passports, we are not aware of any studies assessing the impact that proof of vaccination status for domestic use or for international travel may have on vaccination inclination and thus--perhaps more importantly--on epidemic spread.

Added value of this studyWe conducted a large-scale survey of more than 17,000 members of the UK public to explore attitudes to vaccine passports for domestic and international use. Bayesian methods are used to compute nationally representative estimates of the impact of vaccine passports on change in inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines and to establish the socio-demographic determinants of vaccination inclination. This study is, as far as we are aware, the first to assess the impact of vaccine passports on vaccination inclination in the UK.

Implications of all the possible evidenceThis study provides novel insights into the potential impact of vaccine passports on COVID-19 vaccine intent in the UK. Although we find that vaccine passports receive popular support in the UK, there exists large variations in their appeal that stratify along socio-demographic lines. Most notably, younger age groups, Black and Black British ethnicities (compared to Whites), and non-English speakers are more likely to express a lower inclination to vaccinate if passports were introduced. Although these groups comprise a relatively small proportion of the UK population, there are crucial issues that these perceptions among these groups cause: notably, that these groups tend to have lower baseline vaccination intent and they cluster geographically. Therefore, since geographic clusters of low vaccination uptake can result in disproportionate increases in required vaccination levels for herd immunity in adjacent settings, we need to exercise extreme caution in public health interventions that may push these areas further away from vaccination. This is especially so if such an intervention will have little overall impact on the majority of the population outside these areas who are already quite willing to vaccinate. Overall, we find that the introduction of passports for either domestic or international use has a net negative impact on vaccination inclination, once we control for baseline vaccination intent. Our findings suggest that vaccination passports may not only yield damaging health outcomes for already marginalised communities: this may lead to further distrust in the government and public health systems and may have negative downstream consequences for other health-seeking behaviours, for example, routine immunisations.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed to explore the feasibility of these hybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds for PICU patients from the HCWs perspective.

MethodsA mixed quantitative and qualitative deductive thematic content analysis of narrative responses from pediatric intensive care HCWs were analyzed, descriptive statistics were used

ResultsA total of 31 HCW were included in the analysis; the mean time of the virtual round was 72.45 minutes vs. 34.68 for physical rounds, the most shared component in the virtual round was CXR (93.5%). Some of the HCWs perceived advantages of the hybrid rounds were enabling the multidisciplinary discussions, lesser round interruptions, and practicality of the virtual discussions. The perceived challenges were the difficulty of the bedside nurse to attend the virtual round, decreased teaching opportunities for the trainees, and decreased interactions among the team members, especially if the video streaming was not utilized.

ConclusionHybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds in PICU were perceived as feasible by HCWs. The virtual rounds decreased the physical contact between the HCWs, which could decrease the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spread among the treating team. Still, several components of the hybrid round could be optimized to facilitate the virtual team-members interactions and enhance the teaching experience.",NA,medrxiv
