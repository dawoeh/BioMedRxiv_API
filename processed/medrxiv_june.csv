Heterogeneity in clinical presentation too often delays clinical diagnosis and calls for molecular biomarkers to assist diagnosis, including cell free microRNAs (miRNA). However, nonlinearity in the relationship of miRNAs to clinical states and underpowered cohorts has limited research in this domain. Here, we prospectively enrolled a large cohort of 495 subjects with ALS (n=202) and FTD (n=168), or non-neurodegeneration controls (n=125). Based on cell-free plasma miRNA profiling by next generation sequencing and machine learning approaches, we develop nonlinear prediction models that accurately distinguish ALS and FTD from non-degeneration controls in [~]90% of cases. Among the miRNAs that contribute to classifying disease, we identified miRNAs shared between conditions as well as disease-specific miRNAs. The fascinating potential of diagnostic miRNA biomarkers might enable early-stage detection and cost-effective screening approach for clinical trials that can facilitate drug development.",NA,medrxiv

Whereas the loss of sensitivity can be efficiently measured using pure-tone audiometry, the assessment of supra-threshold hearing deficits remains a challenge. In contrast to the classical  attenuation-distortion model, the proposed BEAR approach is based on the hypothesis that the hearing abilities of a given listener can be characterized along two dimensions, reflecting independent types of perceptual deficits (distortions). A data-driven approach provided evidence for the existence of different auditory profiles with different degrees of distortions. Ten tests were included in a test battery, based on their clinical feasibility, time efficiency and related evidence from the literature. The tests were divided into six categories: audibility, speech perception, binaural processing abilities, loudness perception, spectro-temporal modulation sensitivity and spectro-temporal resolution. Seventy-five listeners with symmetric, mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss were selected from a clinical population. The analysis of the results showed interrelations among outcomes related to high-frequency processing and outcome measures related to low-frequency processing abilities. The results showed the ability of the tests to reveal differences among individuals and their potential use in clinical settings.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsOn December 23, 2019, the Altmetric database was searched using the titles of 11 endodontic journals. The bibliometric data of the top 5% of endodontic articles with the highest tweets number were extracted from the Web of Science and analyzed.

ResultsOverall, 3,918 tweets (from 3,881 individual posts) related to endodontic articles from seven journals were identified, which were mostly from the U.S. The Journal of Endodontics received the most tweets. Systematic review and apical periodontitis were the most popular keywords. At the author level, Dummer PMH and Patel S and at institution level Kings College London and Cardiff University, had the largest number of popular articles in the Twittersphere. The number of tweets was not correlated with citations (r=0.007, P=0.929). No statistically significant differences were found between open access (n=41, Mean=11.19) and non-open access (n=136, Mean=9.38) articles regarding the number of tweets (P=0.648).

ConclusionsIn the  Twittersphere, the overall activity of endodontic journals and associations were low. They could be more active and increase their visibility and social impact by immediately sharing research outcomes and communicating with peers, practitioners, and patients.",NA,medrxiv

In this large-scale study, we sought to validate previously-reported associations and test new hypotheses using statistical analysis of two very large datasets incorporating electronic medical records (EMRs). One of the datasets represents over half ([~]150 million) of the US population for over 8 years (IBM Watson Health MarketScan insurance claims) while another covers the entire Swedish population ([~]9 million) for over 30 years (the Swedish National Patient Register). After testing more than 100 hypotheses, we showed that neither dataset supported models in which the SRB changed seasonally or in response to variations in ambient temperature. However, increased levels of a diverse array of air and water pollutants, were associated with lower SRBs, including increased levels of industrial and agricultural activity, which served as proxies for water pollution. Moreover, some exogenous factors generally considered to be environmental toxins turned out to induce higher SRBs. Finally, we identified new factors with signals for either higher or lower SRBs. In all cases, the effect sizes were modest but highly statistically significant owing to the large sizes of the two datasets. We suggest that while it was unlikely that the associations have arisen from sex-specific selection mechanisms, they are still useful for the purpose of public health surveillance if they can be corroborated by empirical evidences.

Author SummaryThe human sex ratio at birth (SRB), usually slightly greater than 1/2, have been reported to vary in response to a wide array of exogenous factors. In the literature, many such factors have been posited to be associated with higher or lower SRBs, but the studies conducted so far have focused on no more than a few factors at a time and used far smaller datasets, thus prone to generating spurious correlations. We performed a series of statistical tests on 2 large, country-wide health datasets representing the United States and Sweden to investigate associations between putative exogenous factors and the SRB, and were able to validate a set of previously-reported associations while also discovering new signals. We propose to interpret these results simply as public health indicators awaiting further empirical confirmation rather than as implicated in (adaptive) sexual selection mechanisms.",NA,medrxiv

Conflicting models have been proposed to explain this effect. We sought to test the emotional context insensitivity hypothesis, which suggests that reactivity to positive and negatively-valenced emotional stimuli is blunted in depression, in a preregistered study.

MethodsForty-one depressed participants and 41 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were presented a series of unpleasant and neutrally-valenced pictures in a passive view paradigm while acquiring electroencephalography (EEG). The late positive potential (LPP), an EEG correlate of emotional reactivity, was compared between groups using mixed-effects repeated-measures models and exploratory cluster-based permutation tests. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of LPP findings by reanalysing the LPPs using 22 EEG pipelines from studies identified in the literature.

ResultsWe found no difference in LPP amplitudes between MDD and healthy individuals using the preregistered analysis pipeline. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the magnitude and direction of LPP effect sizes were affected by the analysis pipeline. Exploratory permutation analyses revealed an electrode cluster that showed a significant reduction in the LPP for MDD participants while viewing unpleasant pictures.

ConclusionsThese results do not provide evidence in support of the emotional context insensitivity hypothesis, except for the exploratory data-driven approach. Methodological differences, in particular in the analysis pipeline, contribute to the heterogeneity of LPP modulation in depression. A standardised approach to quantify EEG correlates of emotional reactivity is needed to evaluate alternative models of emotional reactivity in depression.",NA,medrxiv

Assessing the impact of such openings in relation to the risk of a resumption of the spread of the disease is an extremely difficult problem due to the many unknowns concerning the actual number of people infected, the actual reproduction number and infection fatality rate of the disease. In this work, starting from a compartmental model with a social structure and stochastic inputs, we derive models with multiple feedback controls depending on the social activities that allow to assess the impact of a selective relaxation of the containment measures in the presence of uncertain data. Specific contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations have been considered.

The objective of this study was to establish the performance of a syndromic molecular diagnostic approach, using a custom TaqMan array card (TAC) covering 52 respiratory pathogens, and assess its impact on antimicrobial prescribing.

MethodsThe TAC was validated against a retrospective multi-centre cohort of broncho-alveolar lavage samples. The TAC was assessed prospectively in patients undergoing investigation for suspected pneumonia, with a comparator cohort formed of patients investigated when the TAC laboratory team were unavailable.

Co-primary outcomes were sensitivity compared to conventional microbiology and, for the prospective study, time to result. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to validate findings in prospective samples. Antibiotic free days (AFD) were compared between the study cohort and comparator group.

Results128 stored samples were tested, with sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 88-100%). Prospectively 95 patients were tested by TAC, with 71 forming the comparator group. TAC returned results 51 hours (IQR 41-69 hours) faster than culture and with sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 83-98%) compared to conventional microbiology. 94% of organisms identified by sequencing were detected by TAC. There was a significant difference in the distribution of AFDs with more AFDs in the TAC group (p=0.02). TAC group were more likely to experience antimicrobial de-escalation (OR 2.9 (95%1.5-5.5).

To this end, we develop DELPHI, a novel epidemiological model that captures the effect of under-detection and government intervention. We applied DELPHI across 167 geographical areas since early April, and recorded 6% and 11% two-week out-of-sample Median Absolute Percentage Error on cases and deaths respectively. Furthermore, DELPHI successfully predicted the large-scale epidemics in many areas months before, including US, UK and Russia. Using our flexible formulation of government intervention in DELPHI, we are able to understand how government interventions impacted the pandemics spread. In particular, DELPHI predicts that in absence of any interventions, over 14 million individuals would have perished by May 17th, while 280,000 current deaths could have been avoided if interventions around the world started one week earlier. Furthermore, we find mass gathering restrictions and school closings on average reduced infection rates the most, at 29.9 {+/-} 6.9% and 17.3 {+/-} 6.7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay-at-home, on average reduced the infection rate by 74.4 {+/-} 3.7% from baseline across countries that implemented it.

Helmet NIV is low-cost, readily available, provides viral filters between the patient and clinician, and may reduce the need for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been limited, however, by the lack of a respiratory monitoring system needed to address known safety vulnerabilities and to monitor patients. To address these safety and clinical needs, we developed an inexpensive respiratory monitoring system based on readily available components suitable for local manufacture. Open-source design and manufacturing documents are provided. The monitoring system comprises flow, pressure and CO2 sensors on the expiratory path of the helmet circuit and a central remote station to monitor up to 20 patients.

MethodsThe system is validated in bench tests, in human-subject tests on healthy volunteers, and in experiments that compare respiratory features obtained at the expiratory path to simultaneous ground-truth measurements from proximal sensors.

FindingsMeasurements of flow and pressure at the expiratory path are shown to deviate at high flow rates, and the tidal volumes reported via the expiratory path are systematically underestimated.

InterpretationHelmet monitoring systems exhibit high-flow rate, non-linear effects from flow and helmet dynamics. These deviations are found to be within a reasonable margin and should, in principle, allow for calibration, correction and deployment of clinically accurate derived quantities.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSRespiratory monitoring is standard when treating intubated patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. In contrast, respiratory monitoring systems have not been developed for helmet non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Previous measurements of CO2 concentration in the helmet versus flow rate have been published and serve as the primary guide for setting the minimum flow rate for patient treatment of helmet NIV. Similar studies have explored optimal PEEP settings for clinical treatment. However, in practice, respiratory profiles are not measured during helmet treatment and more evidence is needed to evaluate whether clinically useful quantities, such as tidal volume, can be accurately measured during helmet NIV, to provide the same level of clincially relevant monitoring that is standard with invasive ventliation.

Added value of this studyDue to the widespread need for inexpensive multi-patient respiratory monitoring systems to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, a helmet NIV monitoring system was developed and validated with bench tests, human-subject tests on healthy volunteers, and in experiments that compare respiratory features obtained at the expiratory path to simultaneous ground-truth measurements from proximal sensors. At high flow rate, the non-linear effects from the flow and helmet dynamics are observed and have a measurable effect on the estimation of tidal volumes and derived quantities.

Implications of all the available evidenceHelmet monitoring systems for NIV are in wide-spread use for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019. The introduction of respiratory monitoring systems for helmet NIV addresses important safety concerns and opens up the possibility of providing clinically relevant derived quantities to track disease progression. A systematic study of deviations between expiratory path measurements and ground-truth proximal sensors was conducted in bench tests and human-subject tests of health volunteers. The non-linear flow and helmet dynamics effects the accuracy of derived quantities at high flow rates. These deviations are found to be within a reasonable margin and should, in principle, allow for calibration, correction and deployment of clinically accurate derived quantities. An inexpensive implementation of the respiratory monitoring system was achieved to cope with the immense scale of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further steps to improve the quality of care for COVID-19 helmet NIV treatment can be achieved through the additional of respiratory monitoring systems that adjust for high flow-rate deviations in the estimation of tidal volumes and derived quantities.",NA,medrxiv

We present a retrospective review of twenty-nine patients (n=29) from a metropolitan tertiary pain service who have been receiving sub-lingual ketamine trouches / lozenges between the period of 2012-2019.

There was a wide range of dosages used from 25-600mg in divided doses. The duration of treatment ranged from 2-89 months. There was no association with either the dosage or duration of treatment and frequency of side effects. There was an overall reduction in the use of opioids, gabapentinoids or benzodiazepines in 59% of patients with 39% having a complete cessation of an analgesic agent. Side effects were reported in 24%, but only 7% discontinued the treatment due to the side effect (drowsiness). There were no reports of renal impairment, cystitis or hepatotoxicity.

Adjusted rates were computed extending the last available population structure back in time to assess the death rates that would have been observed if the present population had died at the age/sex-specific death rates observed in the past.

Age/sex-adjusted, 52-week death rate had not been as high as the observed rate 10.671 x 10-3 in the past 13 years.

A Poisson regression since 2013 predicted a death rate of 8.807 x 10-3 from which excess death rate is estimated as 1.864 x10-3 (95% confidence interval, 1.846 x 10-3 to 1.881 x 10-3; P - score = 21.2% and z - score = 11.9) with an unbiased standard deviation of the residuals equal to 156 x 10-6. This translates into 88 242 excess deaths (87 405 to 89 079) with an unbiased standard deviation of the residuals equal to 7396 deaths.

We have developed GenRe-Mekong, a platform for genetic surveillance of malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) that enables NMCPs to implement large-scale surveillance projects by integrating simple sample collection procedures in routine public health procedures. Samples are processed by high-throughput technologies to genotype several drug resistance markers, species markers and a genomic barcode, delivering reports of genotypes and phenotype predictions, used to map prevalence of resistance to multiple drugs. GenRe-Mekong has worked with NMCPs and research projects in eight countries, processing 9,623 samples from clinical cases. Monitoring resistance markers has been valuable for tracking the rapid spread of parasites resistant to the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination therapy. In Vietnam and Laos, GenRe-Mekong data have provided novel knowledge about the spread of these resistant strains into previously unaffected provinces. GenRe-Mekong facilitates data sharing by aggregating results from different countries, enabling cross-border resistance monitoring.

The reproduction number Rt indicates the average number of cases generated by an infected person at time t and is a key indicator of the spread of an epidemic. A timely estimation of Rt is a crucial tool to enable governmental organizations to adapt quickly to these changes and assess the consequences of their policies. The EpiEstim method is the most widely accepted method for estimating Rt. But it estimates Rt with a delay of several days. Here, we propose a new method, EpiInvert, that shows good agreement with EpiEstim, but that provides estimates of Rt up to 9 days in advance. We show that Rt can be estimated by inverting the renewal equation linking Rt with the observed incidence curve of new cases, it. Our signal processing approach to this problem yields both Rt and a restored it corrected for the ""weekend effect"" by applying a deconvolution + denoising procedure. The implementations of the EpiInvert and EpiEstim methods are fully open-source and can be run in real-time on every country in the world, and every US state through a web interface at www.ipol.im/ern.

Significance StatementBased on a signal processing approach we propose a method to compute the reproduction number Rt, the transmission rate of an epidemic over time. Rt is estimated by minimizing a functional that enforces: (i) the ability to produce an incidence curve it corrected of the weekly periodic bias produced by the ""weekend effect"", obtained from Rt through a renewal equation ; (ii) the regularity of Rt. A good agreement is found between our Rt estimate and the one provided by the currently accepted method, EpiEstim, except our method predicts Rt almost nine days closer to the present. We provide the mathematical arguments for this shift. Both methods, applied every day on each country, can be compared at www.ipol.im/ern.",NA,medrxiv

ObjectiveTo know how far the virus has spread in Niger State, Nigeria, a pilot study was carried out to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, patterns, dynamics, and risk factors in the state.

MethodsA cross sectional study design and Clustered-Stratified-Random sampling strategy were used to select 185 test participants across the state. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Rapid Test Kits (Colloidal gold immunochromatography lateral flow system) were used to determine the presence or absence of the antibodies to the virus in the blood of sampled participants across Niger State as from 26th June 2020 to 30th June 2020. The test kits were validated using the blood samples of some of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) confirmed positive and negative COVID-19 cases in the State. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Test results were entered into the EPIINFO questionnaire administered simultaneously with each test. EPIINFO was then used for to calculate arithmetic mean and percentage, odd ratio, chi-square, and regression at 95% Confidence Interval of the data generated.

ResultsThe seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Niger State was found to be 25.41% and 2.16% for the positive IgG and IgM respectively. Seroprevalence among age groups, gender and by occupation varied widely. COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection are almost the same for both urban and rural dwellers in the state. However, health care workers, those that experienced flu-like symptoms and those that have had contact with person (s) that travelled out of Nigeria in the last six (6) months (February -June 2020) are twice (2 times) at risk of being infected with the virus. More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing at any time since the pandemic started. Discussions about knowledge, practice and attitude of the participants are included.

ConclusionThe observed Niger State SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and infection patterns means that the virus is widely spread, far more SARS CoV-2 infections occurred than the reported cases and high asymptomatic COVID-19 across the state.",NA,medrxiv

Pre-pandemic racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of Coronavirus specific forms of discrimination on mental health have not been examined. This study assessed the effect of previously identified social determinants of mental health and COVID-19 specific victimization and racial bias beliefs on depression and anxiety among young adults of color in the U.S.

MethodsA national online survey of 399 AIAN, Asian, Black, and Latinx adults (18 - 25 years) included demographic variables, COVID-19 health risks, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, Coronavirus related victimization distress and perceptions of Coronavirus-related racial bias across a range of contexts.

ResultsEmployment, financial and prescription insecurity, COVID-19 health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs were positively correlated with depression and anxiety. Scores on the Coronavirus racial bias scale were significantly higher among Asian and Black respondents. Structural equation modeling controlling for race/ethnicity and demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health indices.

ConclusionResults suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.",NA,medrxiv

However, a critical barrier to the routine application of WGS for infection prevention is the lack of reliable criteria for determining if a genomic linkage is consistent with transmission.

MethodsHere, we sought to understand the genomic landscape in a high-transmission healthcare setting by performing WGS on 435 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates collected from 256 patients through admission and biweekly surveillance culturing of virtually every hospitalized patient over a 1-year period.

FindingsOur analysis revealed that the standard approach of employing a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) threshold to define transmission would lead to both false-positive and false-negative inferences. False positive inferences were driven by the frequent importation of closely related strains, which were presumably linked via transmission at a connected healthcare facility. False negative inferences stemmed from the diversity of colonizing populations being spread among patients, with multiple examples of hypermutator strains emerging within patients and leading to putative transmission links separated by large genetic distances. Motivated by limitations of an SNV threshold, we implemented a novel threshold-free transmission cluster inference approach whereby each of the 234 acquired CRE isolates were linked back to the imported CRE isolate with which it shared the most variants. This approach yielded clusters that varied in levels of genetic diversity but were highly enriched in patients sharing epidemiologic links. Holistic examination of clusters highlighted extensive variation in the magnitude of onward transmission stemming from the more than 100 importation events and revealed patterns in cluster propagation that could inform improvements to infection prevention strategies.

InterpretationOverall, our results show how the integration of culture surveillance data into genomic analyses can overcome limitations of cluster detection based on SNV-thresholds and improve our ability to track pathways of pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published before May 1, 2021, with no start date restriction, with the search ""transmission AND whole-genome AND (snp OR snv) AND (cut-off OR threshold) NOT (SARS-CoV-2 OR virus or HIV)"". We identified 18 reports that used whole genome sequencing to study transmission, primarily in healthcare settings. Several of these studies attempted to identify optimal single nucleotide variant (SNV) cutoffs for delineating transmission. These studies were all single-site and had only partial sampling of healthcare facilities. Moreover, even when the same species was considered, different optimal SNV thresholds were reported.

Added value of this studyTo understand the limitations of an SNV threshold approach for tracking transmission we leveraged a data set that comprised admission and every-other-week CRE surveillance culturing for every patient entering a hospital over the course of one year. By performing genomic analysis of 435 isolates from the 256 CRE colonized patients we systematically demonstrated pitfalls with the use of SNV thresholds for transmission inference that stem from the importation of closely related strains from connected healthcare facilities, variation in genetic heterogeneity of colonizing populations and uneven evolutionary rates of CRE strains colonizing patients. We went on to implement an alternative approach for tracking transmission in healthcare facilities that relies on genetic context, instead of genetic distance to group patients into intra-facility transmission clusters. We applied this approach to our CRE genomes and demonstrated that the resultant transmission clusters are strongly enriched in patients with spatiotemporal overlap, and that clusters can be interrogated to identify putative targets to interrupt transmission.

Implications of all the available evidenceAdvances in the speed and economy of genome sequencing are making it increasingly feasible to perform routine sequencing to track transmission in healthcare settings. However, a critical barrier to these efforts is the lack of clear criteria for inferring transmission that generalizes to diverse strains of healthcare pathogens and that are robust to variation in organism prevalence and differences in connectivity of local healthcare networks. Here, we show that by combining genome sequencing with surveillance data that healthcare transmission can be inferred in a threshold-free manner. The success of this approach in a setting with high importation and transmission rates bodes well for its generalizability to less challenging healthcare settings.",NA,medrxiv

However, patients with pathogenic SVs undetectable by conventional analysis often remain undiagnosed. Consequently, we have developed the novel tool  InDelible, which interrogates short-read sequencing data for split-read clusters characteristic of SV breakpoints. We applied InDelible to 13,438 probands with severe DD recruited as part of the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and discovered 64 rare, damaging variants in genes previously associated with DD missed by standard SNV, InDel or CNV discovery approaches. Clinical review of these 64 variants determined that about half (30/64) were plausibly pathogenic. InDelible was particularly effective at ascertaining variants between 21-500 bps in size, and increased the total number of potentially pathogenic variants identified by DDD in this size range by 42.3%. Of particular interest were seven confirmed de novo variants in MECP2 which represent 35.0% of all de novo protein truncating variants in MECP2 among DDD patients. InDelible provides a framework for the discovery of pathogenic SVs that are likely missed by standard analytical workflows and has the potential to improve the diagnostic yield of ES across a broad range of genetic diseases.",NA,medrxiv

The appropriate approach for the further assessment and clinical management of these children is currently unclear. In this Sensitive Indicators of Childhood Listening Difficulties (SICLiD) study we assessed listening ability using a reliable and validated caregiver questionnaire (the ECLiPS) in a large (n = 146) and heterogeneous sample of 6-13 year-old children with normal audiograms. Scores on the ECLiPS were related to a multifaceted laboratory assessment of the childrens audiological, psycho- and physiological-acoustic and cognitive abilities. This report is an overview of the SICLiD study and focuses on the childrens behavioral performance. The overall goals of SICLiD were to understand the auditory and other neural mechanisms underlying childhood listening difficulties and to translate that understanding into clinical assessment and, ultimately, intervention.

DesignCross-sectional behavioral assessment of children with  listening difficulties and an age-matched  typically developing control group. Caregivers completed the ECLiPS and the resulting Total standardized composite score formed the basis of further descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate modeling of experimental data.

ResultsAll scores of the ECLiPS, the SCAN-3:C, a standardized clinical test suite for auditory processing, and the NIH Cognition Toolbox were significantly lower for children with listening difficulties than for their typically developing peers, using group comparisons via t-tests and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. A similar effect was observed on the LiSN-S test for speech sentence-in-noise intelligibility, but only reached significance for the Low Cue and High Cue conditions, and the Talker Advantage derived score. Stepwise regression to examine the factors contributing to the ECLiPS Total scaled score (pooled across groups) yielded a model that explained 42% of its variance based on the SCAN-3:C composite, LiSN-S Talker Advantage, and the NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary and Dimensional Change Card Sorting scores (F4,95 = 17.35, p < 0.001). High correlations were observed between many test scores including the ECLiPS, SCAN-3:C and NIH Toolbox composite measures. LiSN-S Advantage measures generally correlated weakly and non-significantly with non-LiSN-S measures. However, a significant interaction was found between extended high frequency threshold and LiSN-S Talker Advantage.

ConclusionsChildren with listening difficulties but normal audiograms have problems with the cognitive processing of auditory and non-auditory stimuli that include both fluid and crystallized reasoning. Analysis of poor performance on the LiSN-S Talker Advantage measure identified subclinical hearing loss as a minor contributing factor to talker segregation. Beyond auditory tests, evaluations of children with complaints of listening difficulties should include standardized caregiver observations and consideration of broad cognitive abilities.",NA,medrxiv

We adopted a multivariate and neurodynamical approach to the analysis of EEG modulations evoked by touch to highlight differences between patients and healthy controls, between affected and unaffected side of the body, and between ""passive"" (i.e. no task demands and equiprobable digit stimulation) and ""active"" tactile processing (i.e. where a digit discrimination task was administered and spatial probability manipulated). When correct identifications are considered, an early reduction in cortical decodability (28-56 ms) distinguishes CRPS patients from healthy volunteers. However, when error trials are included in the classifiers training, there is an unexpected increased decodability in the CRPS group compared to healthy volunteers (280-320 ms). These group differences in neural processing seemed to be driven by the affected rather than the unaffected side. We corroborated these findings with several exploratory analyses of neural representation dynamics and behavioural modelling, highlighting the need for single participant analyses. Although several limitations impacted the robustness and generalizability of these comparisons, the proposed analytical approach yielded promising insights (as well as possible biomarkers based on neural dynamics) into the relatively unexplored alterations of tactile decision-making and attentional control mechanisms in chronic CRPS.",NA,medrxiv

The FebriDx LFD is designed to distinguish between viral and bacterial respiratory infection.

MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, LitCovid, ClinicalTrials.gov and preprint servers on the 13th of January 2021 to identify studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx (myxovirus resistance protein A component) versus real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients suspected of COVID-19. IPD were sought from studies meeting the eligibility criteria. Studies were screened for risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate linear mixed model was fitted to the data to obtain a pooled estimate of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve of the model was constructed. A sub-group analysis was performed by meta-regression using the same modelling approach to compare pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity between patients with a symptom duration of 0 to 7 days and >7 days, and patients aged between 16 to 73 years and >73 years.

ResultsTen studies were screened, and three studies with a total of 1481 patients receiving hospital care were included. FebriDx produced an estimated pooled sensitivity of 0.911 (95% CI: 0.855-0.946) and specificity of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.802-0.915) compared to RT-PCR. There were no significant differences between the sub-groups of 0 to 7 days and >7 days in estimated pooled sensitivity (p = 0.473) or specificity (p = 0.853). There were also no significant differences between the sub-groups of 16 to 73 years of age and >73 years of age in estimated pooled sensitivity (p = 0.946) or specificity (p = 0.486).

ConclusionsBased on the results of three studies, the FebriDx LFD had high diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 in a hospital setting, however, the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies included, risk of bias, and inconsistent reference standards. Further research is required to confirm these findings, and determine how FebriDx would perform in different healthcare settings and patient populations.

Trial registrationThis study was conducted at pace as part of the COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR) national test evaluation programme (https://www.condor-platform.org), and as a result, no protocol was developed, and the study was not registered.

Lay summaryTests to diagnose COVID-19 are crucial to help control the spread of the disease and to guide treatment. Over the last few months, tests have been developed to diagnose COVID-19 either by detecting the presence of the virus or by detecting specific markers linked to the virus being active in the body. These tests use complex machines in laboratories accepting samples from large geographical areas. Sometimes it takes days for test results to come back. So, to reduce the wait for results, new portable tests are being developed. These  point-of-care (POC) tests are designed to work close to where patients require assessment and care such as hospital emergency departments, GP surgeries or care homes. For these new POC tests to be useful, they should ideally be as good as standard laboratory tests.

In this study we looked at published research into a new test called FebriDx. FebriDx is a POC test that detects the bodys response to infection, and is claimed to be able to detect the presence of any viral infection, including infections due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19, as well as bacterial infections which can have similar symptoms. The FebriDx result was compared with standard laboratory tests for COVID-19 performed on the same patients throat and nose swab sample. We were able to analyse data from three studies with a total of 1481 adult patients who were receiving hospital care with symptoms of COVID-19 during the UK pandemic. Approximately one fifth of the patients were diagnosed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus using standard laboratory tests for COVID-19.

Our analysis demonstrated that FebriDx correctly identified 91 out of 100 patients who had COVID-19 according to the standard laboratory test. FebriDx also correctly identified 87 out of 100 patients who did not have COVID-19 according to the standard laboratory test. These results have important implications for how these tests could be used. As there were slightly fewer FebriDx false results when the results of the standard laboratory test were positive (9 out of 100) than when the results of the standard laboratory test were negative (13 out of 100), we can have slightly more confidence in a positive test result using FebriDx than a negative FebriDx result.

Overall, we have shown that the FebriDx POC test performed well during the UK COVID-19 pandemic when compared with laboratory tests, especially when COVID-19 was indicated. For the future, this means that the FebriDx POC test might be helpful in making a quick clinical decision on whether to isolate a patient with COVID-19-like symptoms arriving in a busy emergency department. However, our results indicate it would not completely replace the need to conduct a laboratory test in certain cases to confirm COVID-19.

There are limitations to our findings. For example, we do not know if FebriDx will work in a similar way with patients in different settings such as in the community or care homes. Similarly, we do not know whether other viral and bacterial infections which cause similar COVID-19 symptoms, and are more common in the autumn and winter months, could influence the FebriDx test accuracy. Our findings are also only based on three studies.",NA,medrxiv

The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening.

MethodsWe used prospective longitudinal RT-qPCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019-20 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases.

FindingsAccording to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95% credible interval [2.5, 4.2]) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 [20.5, 23.9]. The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9 days [7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8 days [6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR substantially improves certainty about a patients infection phase. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patients progress through infection stages. Frequent rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.",NA,medrxiv

SettingAdult or pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) from any country participating in at least one research study before the COVID-19 pandemic.

ParticipantsWe recruited one researcher or research coordinator per center, identified via established research networks.

Intervention(s)None

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Primary: Suspending recruitment in clinical research; Secondary: impact of specific factors on research conduct (5-point scales from no effect to very large effect). We assessed the association between research continuity and month, presence of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and population (pediatric vs. adult ICU) using mixed-effects logistic regression.

Results127 centers (57% pediatric) from 23 countries participated. 95 (75%) of centers suspended recruitment in at least some studies and 37 (29%) suspended recruitment in all studies on at least one month. The proportion of centers reporting recruitment in all studies increased over time (OR per month 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4, p < 0.001), controlling for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and type of ICU (pediatric vs. other). The five factors most frequently identified as having a large or very large effect on clinical research were: local prioritization of COVID-19 specific research (68, 54%), infection control policies limiting access to patients with COVID-19 (61, 49%), infection control policies limiting access to the ICU (52, 41.6%), increased workload of clinical staff (38, 30%), and safety concerns of research staff (36, 29%).

Chamber morphology, tissue motion, atrioventricular valve inflow, and hemodynamic flow parameters were measured.

ResultsPrenatal cardiac output differed between control (LV:157 {+/-} 139 mL/min, RV:257 {+/-} 218 mL/min) and HLHS subjects (410 {+/-} 128 mL/min).

We show that herd immunity is difficult to achieve in case of a high incubation period of the contagion. We derive a method to quantify the success probabilities of quarantine measures to mitigate infection from a population, before achieving herd immunity. We provide a mechanistic derivation of the distribution of generation time from basic principles, which is of central importance to estimate the reproduction number R0, but has been assumed in an ad hoc manner in epidemiological studies, by far.

Various jurisdictions have implemented public health orders as a means of reducing effective contacts and controlling their local epidemics. Multiple studies have examined the effectiveness of various orders (e.g. use of face masks) for epidemic control. However, orders occur at different timings across jurisdictions and some orders on the same topic are stricter than others. We constructed a county-level longitudinal data set of more than 2,200 public health orders issues by California and its 58 counties pertaining to its 40 million residents. First, we describe methods used to construct the dataset that enables the characterization of the evolution over time of California state- and county-level public health orders dealing with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 through May 15, 2021. Public health orders are both an interesting and important outcome in their own right and also a key input into analyses looking at how such orders may impact COVID-19 epidemics. To construct the dataset, we developed and executed a search strategy to identify COVID-19 public health orders over this time period for all relevant jurisdictions. We characterized each identified public health order in terms of the timing of when it was announced, went into effect and (potentially) expired. We also adapted an existing schema to describe the topic(s) each public health order dealt with and the level of stricture each imposed, applying it to all identified orders. Finally, as an initial assessment, we examined the patterns of public health orders within and across counties, focusing on the timing of orders, the rate of increase and decrease in stricture, and on variation and convergence of orders within regions.",NA,medrxiv

To enable early detection it is crucial to study these psychometric properties in childhood. We examined whether PRSs associate more with general or with specific psychopathology in school-aged children. Additionally, we tested whether psychiatric PRSs can be combined into a multi-PRS score for improved performance.

MethodsWe computed 16 PRSs based on GWASs of psychiatric phenotypes, but also neuroticism and cognitive ability, in mostly adult populations. Study participants were 9247 school-aged children from three population-based cohorts of the DREAM-BIG consortium: ALSPAC (UK), The Generation R Study (Netherlands) and MAVAN (Canada). We associated each PRS with general and specific psychopathology factors, derived from a bifactor model based on self-, parental-, teacher-, and observer reports. After fitting each PRS in separate models, we also tested a multi-PRS model, in which all PRSs are entered simultaneously as predictors of the general psychopathology factor.

ResultsSeven PRSs were associated with the general psychopathology factor after multiple testing adjustment, two with specific externalizing and five with specific internalizing psychopathology. PRSs predicted general psychopathology independently of each other, with the exception of depression and depressive symptom PRSs. Most PRSs associated with a specific psychopathology domain, were also associated with general child psychopathology.

ConclusionsThe results suggest that PRSs based on current GWASs of psychiatric phenotypes tend to be associated with general psychopathology, or both general and specific psychiatric domains, but not with one specific psychopathology domain only. Furthermore, PRSs can be combined to improve predictive ability. PRS users should therefore be conscious of non-specificity and consider using multiple PRSs simultaneously, when predicting psychiatric disorders.",NA,medrxiv

While numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established epidemic, mathematical descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical results, and derive new results, to elucidate the early dynamics of an infection cluster started by a single infected individual. We cover the probability of establishment of an epidemic as a function of the distribution of secondary cases, the expectation of epidemic size as a function of time, and the convergence to a deterministic exponential regime. Stochasticity systematically accelerates the initial growth of an epidemic, because epidemics that do not get extinct have faster initial growth on average. This also affects the long-term epidemic growth by increasing the cumulative size by a constant factor, the inverse of the establishment probability, when compared to the deterministic prediction. These results are critical to improve early cluster detection and control. We compute the probability distribution of the first detection time of an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on the testing effort (assumed to be constant in time), and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.1.7 detected in September 2020 first appeared in the United Kingdom early August 2020. We estimate a minimal testing frequency to detect clusters before they exceed a certain threshold size, and we compute the detection rate of infected individuals during a single mass testing effort. For example, in a COVID-19-parameterized model with an effective reproduction number R = 1.1, a fraction 1.3% of a population needs to be randomly tested each day for cluster size to not exceed 30 infected individuals. These results improve our theoretical understanding of early epidemics and will be useful for the study and control of local infectious disease clusters.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed to synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the level and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making.

MethodsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases, preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location, and seroprevalence estimate. We corrected estimates for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian measurement error models, conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634.

ResultsWe identified 968 seroprevalence studies including 9.3 million participants in 74 countries. There were 472 studies (49%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5%, IQR 2.4-8.4%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6% perinatal) to high (59% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6 % in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p<0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p<0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95% CI 2.64-4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.96-3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95% CI 1.01-32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.60-2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18-64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95% CI 1.28-3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9-38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames.

DiscussionMost of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, until vaccine-derived herd immunity is achieved. Improvements in serosurvey design and reporting are needed for ongoing monitoring of infection prevalence and the pandemic response.

MethodsA review of reviews, survey, discrete choice experiment, qualitative interviews and focus groups, all informed a realist evidence synthesis. This in turn informed the design of a complex intervention, guided by the Behaviour Change Wheel framework using a multi-step process.

ResultsKey themes from the realist evidence synthesis included effective safety netting at practitioner and practice system level, increased vigilance and lowering referral thresholds. Qualitative findings explored the tensions, barriers and facilitators affecting suspected cancer referral.

Study DesignCase series - retrospective with a control group.

SettingTertiary care laryngology practice between 2009 to 2019.

MethodsPatients with confirmed UVFP through endoscopic examination (N=77) and controls with normal voices matched for age and sex (N=77) were included. Two tasks were used to elicit voice samples: reading the Rainbow Passage and sustaining phonation of the vowel ""a"". The 88 extended Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS) features were extracted as inputs for four machine learning models of differing complexity. SHAP was used to identify important features.

ResultsThe median bootstrapped Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) score ranged from 0.79 to 0.87 depending on model and task. After removing redundant features for explainability, the highest median ROC AUC score was 0.84 using only 13 features for the vowel task and 0.87 using 39 features for the reading task. The most important features included intensity measures, mean MFCC1, mean F1 amplitude and frequency, and shimmer variability depending on model and task.

ConclusionUsing the largest dataset studying UVFP to date, we achieve high performance from just a few seconds of voice recordings. Notably, we demonstrate that while similar categories of features related to vocal fold physiology were conserved across models, the models used different combinations of features and still achieved similar effect sizes. Machine learning thus provides a mechanism to detect UVFP and contextualize the accuracy relative to both model architecture and pathophysiology.",NA,medrxiv

As of Mid-June 2021, over 1500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced across the country. From our analyses, it was discovered that the wave-2 samples had a significantly greater average rate of mutation/sample (30.79%) than the wave-1 samples (12.32%). Wave-2 samples also had a higher frequency of deletion, and transversion events. During the first wave, the GR clade was the most predominant but it was replaced by the GH clade in the latter wave. The B.1.1.25 variant showed the highest frequency in wave-1 while in case of wave-2, the B.1.351.3 variant, was the most common one.

Framing current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 vaccines in the context of evolutionary theory indicates that prospects for virulence evolution remain uncertain. However, differential effects of vaccinal immunity on transmission and disease severity between respiratory compartments could select for increased virulence. To bound expectations for this outcome, we analyze an evo-epidemiological model. Synthesizing model predictions with vaccine efficacy data, we conclude that while vaccine driven virulence evolution remains a theoretical risk, it is unlikely to threaten prospects for herd immunity in immunized populations. Given that this event would nevertheless impact unvaccinated populations, virulence should be monitored to facilitate swift mitigation efforts.

Significance statementVaccines can provide personal and population level protection against infectious disease, but these benefits can exert strong selective pressures on pathogens. Virulence, or lethality, is one pathogen trait that can evolve in response to vaccination. We investigated whether COVID-19 vaccines could select for increased SARS-CoV-2 virulence by reviewing current evidence about vaccine efficacy and SARS-CoV-2 biology in the context of evolutionary theory, and subsequently analyzing a mathematical model. Our findings indicate that while vaccine-driven virulence evolution in SARS-CoV-2 is a theoretical risk, the consequences of this event would be limited for vaccinated populations. However, virulence evolution should be monitored, as the ramifications of a more virulent strain spreading into an under-vaccinated population would be more severe.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult inpatients with first-episode CDI at our institution from January 2013 to May 2018. The initial vancomycin versus initial metronidazole cohorts were examined using a multivariate logistic regression model.

FindingsPatients (n = 737) had a median age of 72.3 years and 357 (48.4%) had hospital-acquired infection.

This study used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to examine the prevalence and transmission of three key AMR pathogens in two intensive care units in Hanoi, Vietnam.

MethodsA prospective surveillance study of all adults admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (NHTD) and Bach Mai Hospital (BMH) was conducted between June 2017 and January 2018. Clinical and environmental samples were cultured on selective media, characterised using MALDI TOF MS, and illumina sequenced. Phylogenies based on the de novo assemblies (SPAdes) were constructed using Mafft (PARsnp), Gubbins and RAxML. Resistance genes were detected using Abricate against the NCBI database.

Findings3,153 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 369 patients were analysed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed predominant lineages within A. baumannii (global clone [GC]2, sequence types [ST]2, ST571) and K. pneumoniae (ST15, ST16, ST656, ST11, ST147) isolates. Colonisation was most common with E. coli (88.9%) followed by K. pneumoniae (62.4%). Of the E. coli, 91% carried a blaCTX-M variant, while 81% of K. pneumoniae isolates carried blaNDM (54%) and/or blaKPC (45%). Transmission analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 167 clusters involving 251 (68%) patients, in some cases involving patients from both ICUs. There were no significant differences between the lineages or AMR genes recovered between the two ICUs.

InterpretationThis study represents the largest prospective surveillance study of key AMR pathogens in Vietnamese ICUs. Clusters of closely related isolates in patients across both ICUs suggests recent transmission prior to ICU admission in other healthcare settings or in the community.

FundingThis work was funded by the Medical Research Council Newton Fund, United Kingdom; the Ministry of Science and Technology, Vietnam; and the Wellcome Trust, United Kingdom.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGlobally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Ninety percent of these deaths are expected to occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but attributing morbidity and mortality to AMR is difficult in the absence of comprehensive data. Whilst efforts have been made to improve AMR surveillance in these settings, this is often hampered by limited expertise, laboratory infrastructure and financial resources.

Added value of this studyThis is the largest prospective surveillance study of three key AMR pathogens (E. coli, K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii) conducted in critical care settings in Vietnam. Sampling was restricted to patients who were colonised or infected with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing and/or carbapenem-resistant organisms. Colonisation with more than one organism was very common, with multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli being predominant in stool samples. A small number of predominant lineages were identified for K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii, while the E. coli isolates were highly genetically diverse. A large number of genomic clusters were identified within the two ICUs, some of which spanned both ICUs. There were no significant differences between lineages or AMR genes between the two ICUs.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study found high rates of colonisation and infection with three key AMR pathogens in adults admitted to two Vietnamese ICUs. Whilst transmission was common within ICUs the finding of similar lineages and AMR genes in both ICUs suggests that dissemination of AMR occurs prior to ICU admission, either in referral hospitals or in community settings prior to hospital admission. Strategies to tackle AMR in Vietnam will need to account for this by extending surveillance more widely across hospital and community settings.",NA,medrxiv

Methods: We compared the SC frequency among the periods with high cumulative infection rate (above the median of the series) of the first wave of COVID-19, seasonal influenza, and also with the same period of the year before. Results: 1,130 SC were attended during the three periods. No significant reduction in SC was found during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction of hospital admissions might be attributable to patients attending the hospital by their means. The maximum SC workload seen during seasonal influenza has not been reached during the pandemic. We detected a non-significant deviation from the SC protocol, with a slight increase in hospitals transfers to hospitals without stroke units.",NA,medrxiv

Virus-laden aerosols produced by infected patients can propagate throughout ventilated rooms and put medical personnel entering them at risk. Experimental results found with a schlieren optical method have shown that the air flows generated by a cough and normal breathing were modified by the oxygenation technique used, especially when using High Flow Nasal Canulae, increasing the shedding of potentially infectious airborne particles. This study also uses a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics model based on a Lattice Boltzmann Method to simulate the air flows as well as the movement of numerous airborne particles produced by a patients cough within an ICU room under negative pressure. The effects of different mitigation scenarii on the amount of aerosols potentially containing SARS-CoV-2 that are extracted through the ventilation system are investigated. Numerical results indicate that adequate bed orientation and additional air treatment unit positioning can increase by 40% the number of particles extracted and decrease by 25% the amount of particles deposited on surfaces 45s after shedding.

Although the control of COVID-19 has largely focused on the use of basic public health measures (primarily based on using non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine, isolation, social-distancing, face mask usage and community lockdowns), three safe and highly-effective vaccines (by AstraZeneca Inc., Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc., with protective efficacy of 70%, 94.1% and 95%, respectively) have been approved for use in humans since December 2020. We present a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the three currently-available anti-COVID vaccines that are administered in humans. The model stratifies the total population into two subgroups, based on whether or not they habitually wear face mask in public. The resulting multigroup model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is fitted and parametrized using COVID-19 cumulative mortality data for the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Conditions for the asymptotic stability of the associated disease-free equilibrium, as well as expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold, are rigorously derived. Numerical simulations of the model show that the size of the initial proportion of individuals in the masks-wearing group, together with positive change in behaviour from the non-masks wearing group (as well as those in masks-wearing group do not abandon their masks-wearing habit) play a crucial role in effectively curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. This study further shows that the prospect of achieving herd immunity (required for COVID-19 elimination) in the U.S., using any of the three currently-available vaccines, is quite promising. In particular, while the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine will lead to herd immunity in the U.S. if at least 80% of the populace is vaccinated, such herd immunity can be achieved using either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine if about 60% of the U.S. population is vaccinated. Furthermore, the prospect of eliminating the pandemic in the US in the year 2021 is significantly enhanced if the vaccination program is complemented with nonpharmaceutical interventions at moderate increased levels of compliance (in relation to their baseline compliance). The study further suggests that, while the waning of natural and vaccine-derived immunity against COVID-19 induces only a marginal increase in the burden and projected time-to-elimination of the pandemic, adding the impacts of the therapeutic benefits of the vaccines into the model resulted in a dramatic reduction in the burden and time-to-elimination of the pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

Here, at very high spatio-temporal resolution, we analysed determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a European urban area, Basel-City (Switzerland). Methodology. We combined detailed epidemiological, intra-city mobility, and socioeconomic data-sets with whole-genome-sequencing during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave. For this, we succeeded in sequencing 44% of all reported cases from Basel-City and performed phylogenetic clustering and compartmental modelling based on the dominating viral variant (B.1-C15324T; 60% of cases) to identify drivers and patterns of transmission. Based on these results we simulated vaccination scenarios and corresponding healthcare-system burden (intensive-care-unit occupancy). Principal Findings. Transmissions were driven by socioeconomically weaker and highly mobile population groups with mostly cryptic transmissions, whereas amongst more senior population transmission was clustered. Simulated vaccination scenarios assuming 60-90% transmission reduction, and 70-90% reduction of severe cases showed that prioritizing mobile, socioeconomically weaker populations for vaccination would effectively reduce case numbers. However, long-term intensive-care-unit occupation would also be effectively reduced if senior population groups were prioritized, provided there were no changes in testing and prevention strategies. Conclusions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission through vaccination strongly depends on the efficacy of the deployed vaccine. A combined strategy of protecting risk groups by extensive testing coupled with vaccination of the drivers of transmission (i.e. highly mobile groups) would be most effective at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within an urban area.

Author summaryWe examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns within a European city (Basel, Switzerland) to infer drivers of the transmission during the first wave in spring 2020. The combination of diverse data (serological, genomic, transportation, socioeconomic) allowed us to combine phylogenetic analysis with mathematical modelling on related cases that were mapped to a residential address. As a result we could evaluate population groups driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission and quantify their effect on the transmission dynamics. We found traceable transmission chains in wealthier or more senior population groups and cryptic transmissions in the mobile, young or socioeconomic weaker population groups - these were identified as transmission drivers of the first wave. Based on this insight, we simulated vaccination scenarios for various vaccine efficacies to reflect different approaches undertaken to handle the epidemic. We conclude that vaccination of the mobile inherently younger population group would be most effective to handle following waves.",NA,medrxiv

We therefore developed a flexible individual-based mathematical model for HIV transmission, that comprises a spatial representation and individual-level determinants. We tested this model by calibrating it to the HIV epidemic in Malawi and exploring whether the heterogeneity in HIV prevalence could be caused without accounting for heterogeneity in behaviour. We ran the model for Malawi between years 1975-2030 with five alternative realizations of the geographical structure and mobility: (I) no geographical structure; 28 administrative districts including (II) only permanent relocations between districts, (III) permanent relocations and between-district casual sexual relationships, or (IV) permanent relocations between districts and to/from abroad and between-district casual sex; and (V) a grid of 10x10km2 cells, with permanent relocations and between-cell casual relationships. We assumed HIV was present in 1975 in the districts with >10% prevalence in 2010. We calibrated the models to national and district-level prevalence estimates.

Reaching the national prevalence required all adults to have at least 20 casual sex acts/year until 1990. Models II, III and V reproduced the geographical heterogeneity in prevalence to some extent if between-district relationships were either excluded (Model II) or restricted to minimum (Models III, V). Long-distance casual partnership mixing (Models III-V) mitigated the differences in prevalence substantially; with international migration the differences disappeared completely (Model IV). National prevalence was projected to decrease to 4-5% by 2030. Our model sustained the major differences in HIV prevalence across Malawi, if casual relationships between districts were kept at sufficiently low level. An earlier introduction of HIV into the Southern part of Malawi may thus be one of the explanations to the present heterogeneity in HIV prevalence.

Author summaryThe prevalence of HIV varies greatly across the settings, both globally and within countries. The ability of the commonly used compartmental models to account for the geographical structure and individual-level determinants that cause this heterogeneity is limited. In this project, we developed an individual-based simulation framework for modelling HIV transmission in a real setting. We built the model to take into account an unlimited number of individual-level characteristics, and a geographical representation of the setting that can be defined using an arbitrary resolution and distance matrices. We demonstrate the use of this model by simulating the HIV epidemic of Malawi 1975-2030 and exploring whether the observed heterogeneity could be preserved without taking into account any spatial heterogeneity in sexual behaviour. A relatively simple version of the model reproduced the broad-scale differences in HIV prevalence, but the detailed differences will need further investigation.",NA,medrxiv

SETTINGPopulation-wide analysis using the National Health Information Database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service for 2009-2015.

PARTICIPANTSAsian migrants (n=987,214) in Korea and Korean nationals (n=1,693,281) aged [&ge;]20 years.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESPrevalence of NCD risk factors such as current smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia in 2015. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension from 2010 to 2015.

RESULTSAmong participants aged [&ge;]20 years, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was higher in Chinese, Filipino, and other Asian migrant women (25.6%, 30.9%, and 35.5%, respectively) than in Korean women (23.2%) (P<0.001, P=0.002, P<0.001, respectively). Among participants aged 20-49 years, the age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes was higher in Filipino migrant women than in Korean women (2.6% and 1.8%, respectively; P=0.009). The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was higher in Filipino migrant women than in Korean women (7.7% and 4.2%, respectively; P<0.001). In multivariate analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of developing type 2 diabetes was 1.32 (95% CI; 1.11 to 1.57) among Vietnamese migrant men compared with that among Korean men aged 20-39 years.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIIn 2015, among participants aged [&ge;]20 years, the age-adjusted prevalence of current smoking among Chinese men and other Asian migrant women was higher than that among Korean men and women; the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among Chinese, Filipino, and other Asian migrant women was higher than that among Korean women.
C_LIO_LIDuring 2010-2015, in multivariate analyses, after adjusting for covariates, among participants aged 20-39 years, Vietnamese migrant men were more likely to have type 2 diabetes than Korean men; among participants aged [&ge;]20 years, Filipino migrant women were more likely to have hypertension than Korean women.
C_LIO_LIThe pursuit of better economic, educational, or even social and living environmental needs, combined with the self-selection of migrants as well as the immigration policy of the Korean government may explain the healthy migration advantage concerning diabetes and hypertension among the majority of Asian migrants in Korea.

MethodsWe identified biomarkers with specificity of association with different disease groupings e.g., volatile organic compound (VOCs) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for all cancers. We conducted a review of recent studies (post January 2017) that compared these biomarkers between people exclusively using ENDS and those exclusively smoking tobacco. The percentage differences in these biomarkers, weighted by study size and adjusted for acrolein from other sources, were used as a proxy for the assumed percentage difference in disease harm between ENDS and smoking. These relative differences were applied to previously modelled estimates of smoking-related health loss (in health-adjusted life-years; HALYs).

ResultsThe respective relative biomarker levels (ENDS vs smoking) were: 28% for respiratory diseases (five results, three studies); 42% for cancers (five results, four studies); and 35% for cardiovascular (seven results, four studies). When integrated with the HALY impacts by disease, the overall harm to health from ENDS was estimated to be 33% that of smoking.

ConclusionsThis analysis, suggests that the use of modern ENDS devices (vaping) could be a third as harmful to health as smoking in a high-income country setting. But this estimate is based on a limited number of biomarker studies and is best be considered a likely upper level of ENDS risk given potential biases in our method (i.e., the biomarkers used being correlated with more unaccounted for toxicants in smoking compared to with using ENDS).",NA,medrxiv

Specifically, mechanical ventilation was linked to altered community structure, lower species- and higher strain-level diversity, and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lower respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients identified specific oral bacteria, different to those observed in controls. These oral taxa were found physically associated with proinflammatory immune cells, which showed higher levels of inflammatory markers.

Given difficulties of large-scale quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) implementation, rapid antigen tests (Rapid Ag-T) have been proposed as alternatives in settings like Mexico. Here, we evaluated diagnostic performance of Rapid Ag-T for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated clinical implications compared to qRT-PCR testing in Mexico.

METHODSWe analyzed data from the COVID-19 registry of the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology up to April 30th, 2021 (n=6,632,938) and cases with both qRT-PCR and Rapid Ag-T (n=216,388). We evaluated diagnostic performance using accuracy measures and assessed time-dependent changes in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). We also explored test discordances as predictors of hospitalization, intubation, severe COVID-19 and mortality.

RESULTSRapid Ag-T is primarily used in Mexico City. Rapid Ag-T have low sensitivity 37.6% (95%CI 36.6-38.7), high specificity 95.5% (95%CI 95.1-95.8) and acceptable positive 86.1% (95%CI 85.0-86.6) and negative predictive values 67.2% (95%CI 66.2-69.2).

However, due to limited testing early in development, it is currently difficult to predefine optimal intervention specifications to achieve target health goals or prioritize investment in novel candidate interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can provide quantitative evidence to guide this process. Models can simulate deployment and predict the potential impact of a new intervention before testing by considering operational, health-system, population, and disease characteristics. Here, we present a quantitative approach to guide intervention development. Our method relies on consultation with product development stakeholders to define the putative space of novel intervention specifications. Coupling malaria transmission dynamics models with machine learning enables searching this multi-dimensional space and efficiently identifying optimal properties of candidate interventions to reach a specified target health goal. We demonstrate the power of our approach by application to five malaria interventions currently under development. Aiming for health goals of malaria prevalence reduction, we quantify and rank intervention characteristics which are key determinants of health impact. Furthermore, we identify minimal requirements and tradeoffs between operational factors, intervention efficacy and duration to achieve different levels of impact and show how these vary across disease transmission settings. When single interventions cannot achieve significant impact, our method allows finding optimal combinations of interventions fulfilling the desired health goals. Enabling efficient use of disease transmission dynamics models, our approach supports decision-making and resource investment to develop new malaria interventions.

Significance StatementNovel interventions are needed to reduce malaria burden and tackle insecticide and drug resistance. Developing these interventions entails optimizing their specifications against target health goals. Because clinical evidence is limited early in development, these specifications are defined with little quantitative considerations. Mathematical models simulating disease dynamics can quantify intervention impact; however, their complexity hinders exploring the high-dimensional space of putative intervention characteristics. We established a quantitative approach to guide intervention development through dialogue with product development stakeholders and leveraging models of malaria dynamics with machine learning. Our analysis identifies requirements of efficacy, coverage and duration of effect for five novel malaria interventions to achieve targeted reductions in malaria prevalence, highlighting the role of mathematical models to support intervention development.

The majority ([~]75%) of these sequences originated from three out of 22 EMR countries, and 65.8% of all sequences belonged to GISAID clades GR, GH, G and GV. A delay ranging between 30-150 days from sample collection to sequence submission was observed across all countries, limiting the utility of such data in informing public health policies. We identified ten common non-synonymous mutations represented among SARS-CoV-2 in the EMR and several country-specific ones. Two substitutions, spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L, were predominantly concurrent in most countries. While the single incidence of NSP12_P323L was positively correlated with higher case fatality rates in EMR, no such association was established for the double (spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L) concurrent variant across the region.

Several studies have leveraged a combination of vitals, lab investigations, and clinical data to construct early warning systems for shock. However, these have a limited potential of generalization to diverse settings due to reliance on non-real-time data. Monitoring data from vitals can provide an early real-time prediction of Hemodynamic shock which can precede the clinical diagnosis to guide early therapy decisions. Generalization across age and geographical context is an unaddressed challenge. In this retrospective observational study, we built real-time shock prediction models generalized across age groups (adult and pediatric), ICU-types, and geographies. We developed generalizable models on publicly available eICU dataset, which is externally validated on cohorts derived from more than 0.23 million patient-hours of vitals data from a pediatric ICU in New Delhi and 1 million patient-hours vitals data from the adult ICU MIMIC-III database. Out of 208 hospitals data of eICU, we found 156 eligible for cohort building and split this data hospital-wise in a 5 fold training-validation-test set. Our model predicted hemodynamic shock 8 hours in advance with AUROC of 86 %(SD= 1.4) and AUPRC of 93% (SD =1.2). Our models identified 92% of all the shock events more than 8 hours in advance. Upon external validation on the MIMIC-III cohort, it achieved an AUROC of 87 %(SD =1.8), AUPRC 92 %(SD=1.6). External validation of our models on New Delhis Pediatric SafeICU data achieved an AUROC of 87 %(SD =4) AUPRC 91% (SD=3). Therefore, our models can guide early therapy decisions to save lives, reduce false alarms and address the generalizability gap.

To increase participation and reduce costs, such research is typically unable to utilise ""gold-standard"" methods to ascertain diagnoses, instead relying on remote, self-report measures.

AimsTo assess the comparability of remote diagnostic methods for anxiety and depression disorders commonly used in research.

MethodParticipants from the UK-based GLAD and COPING NBR cohorts (N = 58,400) completed an online questionnaire between 2018-2020. Responses to detailed symptom reports were compared to DSM-5 criteria to generate algorithm-based diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. Participants also self-reported any prior diagnoses from health professionals, termed single-item diagnoses. ""Any anxiety"" included participants with at least one anxiety disorder. Agreement was assessed by calculating accuracy, Cohens kappa, McNemars chi-squared, sensitivity, and specificity.

ResultsAgreement between diagnoses was moderate for MDD, any anxiety, and GAD, but varied by cohort. Agreement was slight to fair for the phobic disorders. Many participants with single-item GAD did not receive an algorithm-based diagnosis. In contrast, algorithm-based diagnoses of the phobic disorders were more common than single-item diagnoses.

ConclusionsAgreement for MDD, any anxiety, and GAD was higher for cases in the case-enriched GLAD cohort and for controls in the general population COPING NBR cohort. For anxiety disorders, single-item diagnoses classified most participants as having GAD, whereas algorithm-based diagnoses distributed participants more evenly across the anxiety disorders.

Multiple successful clinical applications of cancer vaccines have shown good safety and efficacy. Despite the notable progress, significant challenges remain in obtaining consistent immune responses across heterogeneous patient populations, as well as various cancers. We present as a proof of concept a mechanistic mathematical model describing key interactions of a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine with an individual patients immune system. Specifically, the model considers the vaccine concentration of tumor-specific antigen peptides and adjuvant, the patients major histocompatibility complexes I and II copy numbers, tumor size, T cells, and antigen presenting cells. We parametrized the model using patient-specific data from a recent clinical study in which individualized cancer vaccines were used to treat six melanoma patients. Model simulations predicted both immune responses, represented by T cell counts, to the vaccine as well as clinical outcome (determined as change of tumor size). These kinds of models have the potential to lay the foundation for generating in silico clinical trial data and aid the development and efficacy assessment of personalized cancer vaccines.

Author summaryPersonalized cancer vaccines have gained attention in recent years due to the advances in sequencing techniques that have facilitated the identification of multiple tumor-specific mutations. This type of individualized immunotherapy has the potential to be specific, efficacious, and safe since it induces an immune response to protein targets not found on normal cells. This work focuses on understanding and analyzing important mechanisms involved in the activity of personalized cancer vaccines using a mechanistic mathematical model. This model describes the interactions of a personalized neoantigen peptide cancer vaccine, the human immune system and tumor cells operating at the molecular and cellular level. The molecular level captures the processing and presentation of neoantigens by dendritic cells to the T cells using cell surface proteins. The cellular level describes the differentiation of dendritic cells due to peptides and adjuvant concentrations in the vaccine, activation, and proliferation of T cells in response to treatment, and tumor growth. The model captures immune response behavior to a vaccine associated with patient specific factors (e.g., different initial tumor burdens). Our model serves as a proof of concept displaying its utility in clinical outcomes prediction, lays foundation for developing in silico clinical trials, and aids in the efficacy assessment of personalized vaccines.",NA,medrxiv

Many mosquito populations lacked the often-assumed positive relationship with rainfall, instead displaying patterns of abundance that were only weakly or even negatively correlated with precipitation and highlighting the role of temperature, proximity to perennial bodies of water and patterns of land use in shaping the dynamics and seasonality of mosquito populations.

The second objective was to explore the acceptability of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA prospective pre-post study was conducted with first time mothers in Nova Scotia, Canada between July 15th and September 19th, 2020. Participants completed a self-report survey at enrolment (after birth) and six-weeks postpartum. Various standardized measures were used and qualitative feedback on the program was also collected. Paired t-tests were carried out to determine changes from baseline to follow-up on psychosocial outcomes and qualitative feedback was analysed through thematic analysis.

ResultsA total of 88 women enrolled. Self-efficacy increased between baseline (B) and follow-up (F) (B:33.33; F:37.11, p=0.000) while anxiety (STAI) declined (B:38.49; F:34.79; p=0.004).

We hypothesize that computational analysis of imaging data can be used for patient enrichment in clinical trials and hence aimed to establish the appropriate framework for this analysis.

MethodsThis was tested among soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients accrued into a randomized clinical trial (SARC021) that evaluated the efficacy of evofosfamide (Evo), a hypoxia activated prodrug, in combination with doxorubicin (Dox). Notably, SARC021 failed to meet its overall survival (OS) objective. We tested whether a radiomic biomarker-driven inclusion/exclusion criterion could have been used to result in a significant treatment benefit of the Evo+Dox combination compared to Dox monotherapy. 164 radiomics features were extracted from 303 SARC021 patients with lung metastases, divided into training and test sets.

ResultsA single radiomics feature, Short Run Emphasis, was identified as the most informative. Combined into a model along with histological classification and smoking history, an enriched subset (42%) of patients had longer OS in Evo+Dox vs. Dox groups [p=0.01, Hazard Ratio (HR) =0.57 (0.36-0.90)]. Applying the same model and threshold value in an independent test set confirmed the significant survival difference [p=0.002, HR=0.29 (0.13-0.63)], identifying patients most likely to benefit from doxorubicin alone.

Combined ventilation, in which two patients are connected to a single ventilator has been proposed as a bridge while waiting for new ventilators availability. DuplicAR is a new device that allows individualization of ventilatory parameters in combined ventilation models.

Materials and MethodsWith an electronic circuit simulator applet, an electrical model of combined ventilation was created using resistor-capacitor circuits. The DuplicAR system electrical analog was added to the model. Through computational simulation, the model is tested in different scenarios with the aim of achieving adequate ventilation of two subjects under different circumstances: 1) two identical subjects; 2) two subjects with the same size but different lung compliance; and 3) two subjects with different size and compliance. The goal is to achieve the established load per unit of size on each capacitor under different levels of end-expiratory voltage (analog of end-expiratory pressure). Data collected included capacitor load and voltage, and load normalized to the weight of the simulated patient.

ResultsIn the three simulated stages, it is possible to provide the proper load to each capacitor under different circumstances. If the pair of connected capacitors have different capacitances, adjustments must be made to the source voltage and/or the resistance of the DuplicAR system to provide the appropriate load for each capacitor under initial conditions. In pressure control simulation, increasing the end-expiratory voltage on one capacitor requires increasing the source voltage and the resistance on the other capacitor. On the other hand, in the volume control simulation, it is only required to intervene in the resistance.

ConclusionsUnder simulated conditions, the electrical model of the DuplicAR system allows individualization of combined mechanical ventilation.",NA,medrxiv

A major limitation of DL models is output instability, as small perturbations in input data can dramatically alter model output. The purpose of the study is to investigate the robustness of DL models in the oncologic image domain through the application of adversarial images: manipulated images with small pixel-level perturbations designed to assess the stability of DL models.

Experimental DesignWe examined the impact of adversarial images on the classification accuracies of DL models trained to classify cancerous lesions across three common oncologic imaging modalities (CT, mammogram, and MRI). The CT model was trained to classify malignant lung nodules using the LIDC dataset. The mammogram model was trained to classify malignant breast lesions using the DDSM dataset. The MRI model was trained to classify brain metastases using an institutional dataset. We also explored the utility of an iterative adversarial training approach to improve the stability of DL models to small pixel-level changes.

ResultsOncologic images showed instability with small pixel-level changes. A pixel-level of perturbation of .004 resulted in a majority of oncologic images to be misclassified by their respective DL models (CT 25.64%, mammogram 23.93%, MRI 6.36%). Adversarial training mitigated improved the stability and robustness of DL models trained on oncologic images compared to naive models [(CT 67.72% vs 26.92%), mammogram (63.39% vs 27.68%), MRI (87.20% vs 24.32%)].

ConclusionsDL models naively trained on oncologic images exhibited dramatic instability to small pixel-level changes resulting in substantial decreases in accuracy. Adversarial training techniques improved the stability and robustness of DL models to such pixel-level changes. Prior to clinical implementation, adversarial training should be considered to proposed DL models to improve overall performance and safety.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe developed four methods for monitoring annual measures by month: 1) Monthly Proportion: The proportion of patients with one or more encounters in the month who still needed to meet the measure at their first encounter of the month and met the measure by the end of the month; (2) Monthly Lookback Proportion: The proportion of patients seen in the month who met the measure by the end of the month, regardless of whether it was met in that month or previously in the reporting year; (3) Rolling 12 Month: The annual measure reported as if each month was the twelfth month of a twelve-month reporting period; and (4) YTD (Year-to-Date) Cumulative: The proportion of patients with one or more visits from the start of the reporting year through the month who satisfy the measure. We applied each method to two annual dental quality measures using data from two reporting years, and four different dental sites. We used mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate year-end predictive performance.

Focusing on COVID-19 epidemics, we develop and analyse mathematical models to explore how these three factors may affect early and final epidemic dynamics. Regarding the date of origin, we find limited effects on the mean estimates, but strong effects on their variances.

We use the excess mortality instead to show the effect of most restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (mrNPIs) as compared to less restrictive NPIs (lrNPIs) concerning growth rate and death counts.

MethodsWe estimate the COVID-19 growth rate for Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, UK and USA from the excess mortality. We use the average growth rate obtained for Sweden and South Korea, the only countries with lrNPIs only, to estimate additional death numbers in the other countries, had mrNPIs not been applied.

ResultsThe growth rate estimated from excess mortality decreased faster for countries with mrNPIs than for Sweden and South Korea, suggesting that the mrNPIs do have a non-negligible effect. Implementing lrNPIs instead of mrNPIs results in up to 3 times higher death numbers. This is not visible when the growth rate is calculated using the reported case numbers of COVID-19 instead of the excess mortality.

ConclusionThe conclusion for the spreading of COVID-19 obtained from reported COVID-19 cases in previous studies are most likely biased. Using our method, a more realistic estimate of the growth rate is obtained. Conclusions made for the reproduction number derived from the reported case numbers, such as the apparent insignificance of mrNPIs (lockdowns), might therefore be wrong and will have to be reevaluated using the growth rates obtained with our method.",NA,medrxiv

Impact statementRoutine and campaign vaccination disruption in 2020 may lead to measles outbreaks and yellow fever burden increases in some countries, but is unlikely to greatly increase meningococcal A burden.

SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSChildhood immunisation services have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO recommends considering outbreak risk using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether to conduct preventive vaccination campaigns during the pandemic.

MethodsWe used 2-3 models per infection to estimate the health impact of 50% reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 and delay of campaign vaccination from 2020 to 2021 for measles vaccination in Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan, for meningococcal A vaccination in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, and for yellow fever vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Our counterfactual comparative scenario was sustaining immunisation services at coverage projections made prior to COVID-19 (i.e. without any disruption).

FindingsReduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 without catch-up vaccination may lead to an increase in measles and yellow fever disease burden in the modelled countries. Delaying planned campaigns in Ethiopia and Nigeria by a year may significantly increase the risk of measles outbreaks (both countries did complete their supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) planned for 2020). For yellow fever vaccination, delay in campaigns leads to a potential disease burden rise of >1 death per 100,000 people per year until the campaigns are implemented. For meningococcal A vaccination, short term disruptions in 2020 are unlikely to have a significant impact due to the persistence of direct and indirect benefits from past introductory campaigns of the 1 to 29-year-old population, bolstered by inclusion of the vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule accompanied by further catch-up campaigns.

InterpretationThe impact of COVID-19-related disruption to vaccination programs varies between infections and countries. Planning and implementation of campaigns should consider country and infection-specific epidemiological factors and local immunity gaps worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic when prioritising vaccines and strategies for catch-up vaccination.

Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 94 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50% of the expected annual mortality. At the same time, in several other countries (Australia, New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), sometimes by two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan).

Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy.

MethodsWe compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior SARS-CoV-2 test reporting from members of 9,224 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population.

ResultsWe estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.41% (95% CI 0.32% - 0.51%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 36% (27% - 48%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 16% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.41 (0.33 - 0.52) to avoid continued growth of the pandemic in Utah.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus.",NA,medrxiv

It is unclear whether the sustained pattern of AF itself is prognostic or if it is confounded by underlying comorbidities. Here, we tested the association between the temporal patterns of AF and the risks of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Methods and Results In a prospective multicenter cohort, 3046 non-valvular AF patients were consecutively enrolled and followed for adverse outcomes of all-cause mortality and ischemic stroke. The risks of both outcomes were adjusted for underlying comorbidities, and compared between the patterns of AF. At baseline, the patients were classified as paroxysmal (N=963, 31.6%), persistent (N=604, 19.8%), and permanent AF (N=1479, 45.6%) according to the standard definition.

MethodsWe surveyed app usage via case investigation interviews at the University of Arizona, with a focus on the period from September 9 to November 28, 2020, after automating the issuance of secure codes to verify positive diagnoses within the test result delivery system. As independent validation, we compared the number of secure codes issued to the number of local cases.

ResultsOf cases interviewed by university case investigators, 46% (286/628) reported having the app, and 55% (157/286) of these app users shared their positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in the app prior to the case investigation interview, comprising 25% (157/628) of all interviewed cases. This is corroborated by a 33% (565/1,713) ratio of code issuance (inflated by some unclaimed codes) to cases. Combining the 25% probability that a primary case rapidly shares their diagnosis with a 46% probability that the secondary case can receive exposure notifications, an estimated 11.4% of transmission pairs exhibit meaningful app usage. High adoption was achieved without the use of ""push"" notifications, in the context of a marketing campaign that leveraged social influencers.

ConclusionsUsage can be assessed, without in-app analytics, within a defined local community such as a college campus rather than an entire jurisdiction. With marketing, high uptake in dense social networks like universities make exposure notification a useful complement to traditional contact tracing. Integrating verification code delivery into patient results portals was successful in making the exposure notification process rapid.

3 question summary boxO_LIWhat is the current understanding of this subject?
The extent to which exposure notification technology reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission depends on usage among cases.
C_LIO_LIWhat does this report add to the literature?
A novel metric estimates meaningful use, and demonstrates potential transmission reduction on a college campus. Clear benefit was seen from simplifying verification of diagnosis with automation during lab result delivery.
C_LIO_LIWhat are the implications for public health practice?
Defined communities can benefit from local deployment and marketing even in the absence of statewide deployment. Lifting current restrictions on deployment would allow more entities such as campuses to copy the model shown here to be successful.

As part of this effort, Norway has been striving to maintain low consumption of antibiotics and drug resistance. This paper aims to review the findings of studies in this regard as an attempt to investigate if the impacts of the countrys antibiotic stewardship strategies are in line with the intention.

MethodA literature review was performed by searching MEDLINE/PubMed to identify peer reviewed articles which dealt with antibiotic use and resistance in Norway. Studies conducted after the year 2000, when a comprehensive national action plan against antibiotic resistance was initiated, were included and the search terms were antibiotic, antimicrobials, resistance and Norway.

ResultsA total of 229 articles were identified of which 75 were included in the review. In primary healthcare settings, hospitals and nursing homes, research themes like adherence to specific institutional guidelines, consumption of antibiotics, patterns of antibiotic resistance, infection prevention/control, as well as resistance profiling were taken up by investigators. Most of the findings highlighted that healthcare facilities are striving to adhere to guidelines and implement strategies outlined in the national strategic plan, despite some challenges. This has resulted in restricting the use of antibiotics thereby maintaining favorable environment to promote their prudent use.

ConclusionBy and large, the findings affirm that the Norwegian healthcare system is characterized by a conservative use of antibiotics that has a positive impact on resistance containment. The authorities need to work further on issues such as adherence to guidelines and infection prevention/control so as to further maximize the prevailing good conditions.",NA,medrxiv

However, there are few data on vaccine efficacy in elderly individuals above the age of 801. Additionally, new variants of concern (VOC) with reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies have raised fears for vulnerable groups. Here we assessed humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination with mRNA vaccine BNT162b22 in elderly participants prospectively recruited from the community and younger health care workers. Median age was 72 years and 51% were females amongst 140 participants. Neutralising antibody responses after the first vaccine dose diminished with increasing age, with a marked drop in participants over 80 years old. Sera from participants below and above 80 showed significantly lower neutralisation potency against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. variants of concern as compared to wild type. Those over 80 were more likely to lack any neutralisation against VOC compared to younger participants following first dose. The adjusted odds ratio for inadequate neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variant in the older versus younger age group was 4.3 (95% CI 2.0-9.3, p<0.001), 6.7 (95% CI 1.7-26.3, p=0.008) and 1.7 (95% CI 0.5-5.7, p=0.41). Binding IgG and IgA antibodies were lower in the elderly, as was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific B-memory cells. We observed a trend towards lower somatic hypermutation in participants with suboptimal neutralisation, and elderly participants demonstrated clear reduction in class switched somatic hypermutation, driven by the IgA1/2 isotype. SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific T-cell IFN{gamma} and IL-2 responses fell with increasing age, and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells. We conclude that the elderly are a high risk population that warrant specific measures in order to mitigate against vaccine failure, particularly where variants of concern are circulating.",NA,medrxiv

The main dataset included 342,393 adults (mean age = 55.87 years, SD = 8.09; 52.61% females). We found statistically significant case-control differences for most physiological measures. There was some evidence that age-related changes in body composition, cardiovascular function, lung function and heel bone mineral density followed different trajectories in depression. These differences did not uniformly narrow or widen with age and differed by sex. For example, BMI in female cases was 1.1 kg/m2 higher at age 40 and this difference narrowed to 0.4 kg/m2 at age 70.

This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and identified factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada, specifically in key priority groups identified by the American Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) for early immunization.

MethodsIndividuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia aged 25-69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Two multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsOf 4,948 respondents, 79.8% intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In multivariable modeling, respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine attitudinal scores (p <0.001), reported greater influence of direct social norms (p = 0.001), and indirect social norms, including their family physician (p = 0.024), and Provincial Health Officer (p = 0.011). Older individuals (>60 years) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine, while females (95%CI 0.57,0.93), those with less than high school education (95%CI 0.5,0.76), those who self-identified as non-white (95%CI 0.60,0.92), self-identified as Indigenous (95%CI 0.36,0.84) and essential non-health care workers (95%CI 0.59,0.86) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsTo optimize vaccine coverage, public health should focus on key messages around vaccine safety and benefit, and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging. As certain key populations identified by NACI and ACIP for early immunization report a lower intention to vaccinate, there is a need for in-depth education and support for these communities to ensure optimal uptake.",10.1186/s12889-021-11098-9,medrxiv

We hypothesized that normal variation in PRS would be associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotypes of brain morphometry and tissue composition.

MethodsWe used the largest extant genome-wide association dataset (N = 69,369 cases and N = 236,642 healthy controls) to measure PRS for schizophrenia in a large sample of adults from the UK Biobank (Nmax = 29,878) who had multiple micro- and macro-structural MRI metrics measured at each of 180 cortical areas, seven subcortical structures, and 15 major white matter tracts. Linear mixed effect models were used to investigate associations between PRS and brain structure at global and regional scales, controlled for multiple comparisons.

ResultsPolygenic risk was significantly associated with reduced neurite density index (NDI) at global brain scale, at 149 cortical regions, five subcortical structures and 14 white matter tracts. Other micro-structural parameters, e.g., fractional anisotropy, that were correlated with NDI were also significantly associated with PRS. Genetic effects on multiple MRI phenotypes were co-located in temporal, cingulate and prefrontal cortical areas, insula, and hippocampus.

ConclusionsRisk-related reduction in NDI, as evident in these data, is plausibly indicative of reduced density of myelinated axons and dendritic arborization in large-scale cortico-subcortical networks. Cortical, subcortical and white matter micro-structure may be linked to the genetic mechanisms of schizophrenia.",NA,medrxiv

ObjectiveThe goal of this study is to develop a traumatic brain injury classification scheme based on open source deep learning computer tomography (CT) analysis and the two serum biomarkers, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal L1 (UCH-L1).

MethodsMachine learning was utilized to develop a novel algorithm capable of classifying the type of brain injury based on a CT scan analysis algorithm and GFAP and UCH-L1 concentrations. Injury was stratified into one of four groups: spontaneous hemorrhage, oxygen deprivation, trauma resulting in vascular injury or high-velocity trauma with negative CT scan.

Outcomes100 research subjects were enrolled. Using a combination of CT analysis and serum markers, the subjects with CT positive trauma were distinguishable from those with spontaneous hemorrhage, ischemic injury, CT negative trauma and controls with AUCs of 0.96, 0.99., 0.98 and 1.00 respectively. Ischemic injury was distinguishable from CT positive trauma with an AUC of 0.98. All forms of brain injury could be distinguished from controls with AUC = 1.00.

Whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cut-off for further psychological investigation were higher in the May sample compared to the October sample, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were higher in the October sample. We investigated potential associations, using general linear regression models (GLM). For schizotypy scores, we found that loneliness, use of drugs, and financial burden were more strongly corrected with schizotypy in the October compared to the May sample. We identified similar associations for GSI, as for schizotypy scores, in the May and October samples. We furthermore found that living in the UK was related to higher schizotypal scores or GSI. However, individual estimates of the GLM are highly comparable between the two countries. In conclusion, this study shows that while the general psychological impact is lower in the October than the May sample, potentially showing a normative response to an exceptional situation; schizotypy scores are higher at the second timepoint, which may be due to a stronger impact of estimates of loneliness, drug use, and financial burden.

Particularly, this stress might lead to suicide.

ObjectWe examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19. Method: We applied the NIID model to suicide deaths from October 2009 through January, 2021 for the whole of Japan by gender. Effects of the great earthquake that struck in eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 were incorporated into the estimation model. Results: Significant excess mortality in suicide was found between July and January for both genders. It was greater among females than among males. In total, 2276 excess cases of mortality were identified.

Discussion and ConclusionExcess mortality during the four months was more than two times greater than the number of COVID-19 deaths confirmed by PCR testing.

Countermeasures against COVID-19 should be chosen carefully in light of suicide effects.",NA,medrxiv

However, a potential bias is that studies tend not to control for the overall heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases caused by an infection. To explore the role of individual variation in infection duration and trans-mission rate on parasite emergence and spread, while controlling for this bias, we simulate stochastic outbreaks with and without parasite evolution. We find, as expected, that heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases decreases the probability of outbreak emergence, but we also find that the source of this heterogeneity matters. Furthermore, for epidemics that do emerge, assuming more realistic variances in infection duration distributions leads to faster outbreaks and higher epidemic peaks. When parasites require adaptive mutations to cause large epidemics, the impact of heterogeneity depends on the underlying evolutionary model. If within-host evolution matters, decreasing the infection duration variance decreases the probability of emergence. These results underline the importance of accounting for realistic distributions of infection duration to accurately anticipate the effect of individual heterogeneity on epidemiological dynamics.",NA,medrxiv

AimsTo examine how different COVID-19-related adverse experiences and adversity worries contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours.

MethodData from 49,324 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed (1 April 2020 to 17 May 2021). Fixed effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experiences and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+ years).

Results26.1% and 7.9% respondents reported self-harm thoughts and behaviours, respectively, at least once over the study period. More adverse experiences were more strongly related to outcomes than worries. Amongst all age groups, the largest specific adversity contributing to increases in both self-harm thoughts (odds ratio (OR) range = 3.37 to 3.90) and behaviours (OR range = 3.39 to 6.96) was having experienced physical or psychological abuse. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were also associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes.

ConclusionsFindings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic. Given the likelihood that the economic and social consequences of the pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.",NA,medrxiv

Performant, rapid and easy-to-use assays are needed for the accurate diagnosis of acute DENV infection. This study evaluated the performance of three prototype assays developed for the VIDAS(R) automated platform to detect dengue NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. Positive and negative agreement with competitor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) was evaluated in 91 Lao patients (57 adults, 34 children) with acute DENV infection. The VIDAS(R) NS1 assay showed the best overall agreement (95.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 89.1-98.8%) with the competitor NS1 ELISA (Focus Diagnostics). Both assays also demonstrated high sensitivity relative to DENV RNA real-time RT-PCR set as gold standard (85.7% [95% CI: 74.3-92.6%] and 83.9% [95% CI: 72.2-91.3%], respectively). Concordance of the VIDAS(R) results was overall higher with the competitor ELISA than with the RDT, suggesting a better performance of VIDAS(R) assays over RDT. The overall agreement of VIDAS(R) IgM and IgG assays with the competitor ELISA (Panbio/Abbott) was moderate (72.5%, 95% CI [62.6-80.6%] for IgM; 76.9%, 95% CI [67.3-84.4%] for IgG), highlighting differences in sensitivity and/or specificity between these assays. In all comparisons, test agreements did not differ significantly between adults and children, indicating comparable performance of the VIDAS(R) assays in both populations. Altogether, the VIDAS(R) dengue prototypes performed very well and appear to be suitable for routine detection of dengue NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM/IgG antibodies.",NA,medrxiv

We characterised the function of the gut microbiota, their metabolites and receptors in untreated human hypertensive participants in Australian metropolitan and regional areas. Ambulatory BP, faecal microbiome predicted from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, plasma and faecal metabolites called short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs), and expression of their receptors were analysed in 70 untreated and otherwise healthy participants from metropolitan and regional communities. Most normotensives were female (66%) compared to hypertensives (35%, P<0.01), but there was no difference in age between the groups (59.2{+/-}7.7 versus 60.3{+/-}6.6-years-old). Based on machine-learning multivariate covariance analyses of de-noised amplicon sequence variant prevalence data, we determined that there were no significant differences in predicted gut microbiome - and {beta}-diversity metrics between normotensives versus essential, white coat or masked hypertensives. However, select taxa were specific to these groups, notably Acidaminococcus spp., Eubacterium fissicatena and Muribaculaceae were higher, while Ruminococcus and Eubacterium eligens were lower in hypertensives. Importantly, normotensive and essential hypertensive cohorts could be differentiated based on gut microbiome gene pathways and metabolites. Specifically, hypertensive participants exhibited higher plasma acetate and butyrate, but their immune cells expressed reduced levels of SCFA-activated G-protein coupled re1ceptor 43 (GPR43). In conclusion, gut microbial diversity did not change in essential hypertension, but we observed a significant shift in microbial gene pathways.

This two-center observational study of 136 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients analyzed the association between disease severity and initial serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. Serum iron levels were significantly lower in patients with mild RF than in the non-RF group; however, there were no significant differences in iron levels between the non-RF and severe RF groups, depicting a U-shaped association between serum iron levels and disease severity. TIBC levels decreased significantly with increasing severity; consequently, TSAT was significantly higher in patients with severe RF than in other patients. Multivariate analysis including only patients with RF adjusted for age and sex demonstrated that higher serum iron and TSAT levels were independently associated with the development of severe RF, indicating that inadequate response to lower serum iron might be an exacerbating factor for COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies, interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the positive association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These results have a causal interpretation in a structural model with unobserved county and time confounders.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies4. Two signature mutations of concern are E484K, which plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here, we report the emergence of a novel variant lineage B.1.526 that contains E484K and its alarming rise to dominance in New York City in recent months. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. It is also less susceptible to neutralization by convalescent plasma or vaccinee sera, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The B.1.526 lineage has now been reported from all 50 states in the US and numerous other countries. B.1.526 has rapidly replaced non-variant lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. Although B.1.526 initially outpaced B.1.1.7 in the region, its growth has slowed concurrent with the rise of B.1.1.7. In states surrounding New York, B.1.526 continues to increase where B.1.1.7 has not yet reached dominance, persistently replacing non-variant lineages.

The World Health Organization has published guidelines for vaccine prioritisation, but most vaccine impact projections have focused on high-income countries, and few incorporate economic considerations. To address this evidence gap, we projected the health and economic impact of different vaccination scenarios in Sindh province, Pakistan (population: 48 million).

Methods and FindingsWe fitted a compartmental transmission model to COVID-19 cases and deaths in Sindh from 30 April to 15 September 2020. We then projected cases, deaths, and hospitalization outcomes over 10 years under different vaccine scenarios. Finally, we combined these projections with a detailed economic model to estimate incremental costs (from healthcare and partial societal perspectives), disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each scenario.

We project that one-year of vaccine distribution, at delivery rates consistent with COVAX projections, using an infection-blocking vaccine at $3/dose with 70% efficacy and 2.5 year duration of protection is likely to avert around 0.9 (95% Credible Interval: 0.9, 1.0) million cases, 10.1 (95% CrI: 10.1, 10.3) thousand deaths and 70.1 (95% CrI: 69.9, 70.6) thousand DALYs, with an ICER of $27.9 per DALY averted from the health system perspective. Varying these assumptions, we generally find that prioritizing the older (65+) population prevents more deaths, but broad distribution from the outset is economically comparable in many scenarios, and either scheme can be cost-effective for low per-dose costs. However, high vaccine prices ($10/dose) may not be cost-effective.

The principal drivers of the health outcomes are the fitted values for the overall transmission scaling parameter and disease natural history parameters from other studies, particularly age specific probabilities of infection and symptomatic disease, as well as social contact rates. Other parameters are investigated in sensitivity analyses.

These projections are limited by the mechanisms present in the model. Because the model is a single-population compartmental model, detailed impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as household isolation cannot be practically represented or evaluated in combination with vaccine programmes. Similarly, the model cannot consider prioritizing groups like healthcare or other essential workers. Additionally, because the future impact and implementation cost of NPIs is uncertain, how these would interact with vaccination remains an open question.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccination can have a considerable health impact, and is likely to be cost-effective if more optimistic vaccine scenarios apply. Preventing severe disease is an important contributor to this impact, but the advantage of focusing initially on older, high-risk populations may be smaller in generally younger populations where many people have already been infected, typical of many low- and -middle income countries, as long as vaccination gives good protection against infection as well as disease.

Author SummaryO_ST_ABSWhy Was This Study Done?C_ST_ABS- The evidence base for health and economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination in low- and middle-income settings is limited.
- Searching PubMed, medRxiv, and econLit using the search term (""coronavirus"" OR ""covid"" OR ""ncov"") AND (""vaccination"" OR ""immunisation"") AND (""model"" OR ""cost"" OR ""economic"") for full text articles published in any language between 1 January 2020 and 20 January 2021, returned 29 (PubMed), 1,167 (medRxiv) and 0 (econLit) studies: 20 overall were relevant, with only 4 exclusively focused on low- or middle-income countries (India, China, Mexico), while 3 multi-country analyses also included low- or middle-income settings,
- However only three of these studies are considered economic outcomes, all of them comparing the costs of vaccination to the costs of non-pharmaceutical interventions and concluding that both are necessary to reduce infections and maximise economic benefit.
- The majority of studies are set in high-income settings and conclude that targeting COVID-19 vaccination to older age groups is the preferred strategy to minimise mortality, particularly when vaccine supplies are constrained, while other age- or occupational risk groups should be priorities when vaccine availability increases or when other policy objectives are pursued.


What Did the Researchers Do and Find?- We combined epidemiological and economic analysis of COVID-19 vaccination based on real-world disease and programmatic information in the Sindh province of Pakistan.
- We found vaccination in this setting is likely to be highly cost-effective, and even cost saving, as long as the vaccine is reasonably priced and efficacy is high.
- Unlike studies in high-income settings, we also found that vaccination programmes targeting all adults may have almost as much benefit as those initially targeted at older populations, likely reflecting the higher previous infection rates and different demography in these settings.


What Do These Findings Mean?- Lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and international bodies providing guidance for LMICs need to consider evidence specific to these settings when making recommendations about COVID-19 vaccination.
- Further data and model-based analyses in such settings are urgently needed in order to ensure that vaccination decisions are appropriate to these contexts.",NA,medrxiv

Studies of the Ag-RDTs have shown variable performance. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the clinical accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of commercially available Ag-RDTs.

Methods and ResultsWe registered the review on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020225140). We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, medRvix and bioRvix, FIND) for publications evaluating the accuracy of Ag-RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 up until April 30th, 2021. Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed and when more than four studies were available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity in comparison to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. We assessed heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, and rated study quality and risk of bias using the QUADAS 2 assessment tool. From a total of 14,254 articles, we included 133 analytical and clinical studies resulting in 214 clinical accuracy data sets with 112,323 samples. Across all meta-analyzed samples, the pooled Ag-RDT sensitivity was 71.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68.2 to 74.0) and increased to 76.3% (CI 73.1 to 79.2) if analysis was restricted to studies that followed the Ag-RDT manufacturers instructions. The LumiraDx showed the highest sensitivity with 88.2% (CI 59.0 to 97.5). Of instrument-free Ag-RDTs, Standard Q nasal performed best with 80.2% sensitivity (CI 70.3 to 87.4). Across all Ag-RDTs sensitivity was markedly better on samples with lower Ct-values, i.e., <20 (96.5%, CI 92.6 to 98.4) and <25 (95.8%, CI 92.3 to 97.8), in comparison to those with Ct [&ge;]25 (50.7%, CI 35.6 to 65.8) and [&ge;]30 (20.9%, CI 12.5 to 32.8). Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in substantially higher sensitivity (83.8%, CI 76.3 to 89.2) compared to testing after one week (61.5%, CI 52.2 to 70.0). The best Ag-RDT sensitivity was found with anterior nasal sampling (75.5%, CI 70.4 to 79.9) in comparison to other sample types (e.g., nasopharyngeal 71.6%, CI 68.1 to 74.9) although CIs were overlapping. Concerns of bias were raised across all data sets, and financial support from the manufacturer was reported in 24.1% of data sets. Our analysis was limited by the included studies heterogeneity in design and reporting, making it difficult to draw conclusions from.

ConclusionIn this study we found that Ag-RDTs detect the vast majority of cases within the first week of symptom onset and those with high viral load. Thus, they can have high utility for diagnostic purposes in the early phase of disease, making them a valuable tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Standardization in conduct and reporting of clinical accuracy studies would improve comparability and use of data.

AUTHOR SUMMARYWhy was this study done? - Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are considered an important diagnostic tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2
- An increasing number of Ag-RDTs is offered on the market, and a constantly growing body of literature evaluating their performance is available
- To inform decision makers about the best test to choose, an up to date summary of their performance is needed


What did the researchers do and find? - On a weekly basis, we search multiple data bases for evaluations of Ag-RDTs detecting SARS-CoV-2 and post the results on www.diagnosticsglobalhealth.org
- Based on the search results up until April 30th, 2021, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, including a total of 133 clinical and analytical accuracy studies
- Across all meta-analyzed studies, when Ag-RDTs were performed according to manufacturers recommendations, they showed a sensitivity of 76.3% (CI 73.1 to 79.2), with the LumiraDx (sensitivity 88.2%, CI 59.0 to 97.5) and of the instrument-free Ag-RDT Standard Q (74.9% sensitivity, CI 69.3 to 79.7) performing best.
- Across all Ag-RDTs, sensitivity increased to 95.8% (CI 92.3 to 97.8) when restricting the analysis to samples with high viral loads (i.e., a Ct-value <25) and to 83.8% (CI 76.3 to 89.2) when tests were performed on patients within the first week after symptom onset


What do these findings mean? - Ag-RDTs detect the vast majority of cases within the first week of symptom onset and those with high viral load. Thus, they can have high utility for diagnostic purposes in the early phase of disease
- Out of all assessed tests, the Lumira Dx showed the highest accuracy. The Standard Q wasthe best performing test when only considering those that dont require an instrument
- A standardization of reporting methods for clinical accuracy studies would enhance future test-comparisons",NA,medrxiv

BackgroundSpread in households represents a major mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In order to take proper action against the spread of the disease, it is important to have a better understanding of transmission in the household domain--including the role of viral load of primary cases.

MethodsThe study was designed as an observational cohort study, using detailed administrative register data. We included the full population of Denmark and all SARS-CoV-2 tests (August 25, 2020 to February 10, 2021) to estimate transmissibility in house-holds comprising 2-6 people. RT-PCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values were used as a proxy for viral load.

ResultsWe identified 63,657 primary cases and 139,882 household members of which 21% tested positive by RT-PCR within a 1-14 day period after the primary case. There was an approximately linear association between Ct value of the sample and transmissibility, implying that cases with samples having a higher viral load were more transmissible than cases with samples having a lower viral load. However, even for primary cases with relatively high sample Ct values, the transmissibility was not negligible, e.g., for primary cases with a sample Ct value of 38, we found that 13% of the primary cases had at least one secondary household case. Moreover, 34% of all secondary cases were found in households with primary cases having sample Ct values >30. An increasing transmissibility with age of the primary cases for adults ([&ge;]20 years) and a decreasing transmissibility with age for children (<20 years) were found.

ConclusionsAlthough primary cases with sample high viral loads (low Ct values) were associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, we found no obvious cut-off for sample Ct values to eliminate transmissibility and a substantial amount of household transmission occurred in households where the primary cases had high sample Ct values (low viral load), The study further showed that transmissibility increases with age. These results have important public health implications, as they suggest that contact tracing should prioritize cases according to Ct values and age, and underline the importance of quick identification and isolation of cases. Furthermore, the study highlights that households can serve as a transmission bridge by creating connections between otherwise separate domains.",NA,medrxiv

We calibrated the model to demographic and location data on 28,175 COVID-19 deaths in California up to December 30, 2020, and incorporated variation in risk by occupation and comorbidity status using published estimates. We estimated the proportion of clinical cases, deaths and DALYs averted relative to a scenario of no vaccination for strategies prioritizing vaccination by a single risk factor (special population status (e.g. incarcerated individual), age, essential worker status, comorbidity status) or multiple risk factors (e.g. age and location).

ResultsWe found that age-based targeting averted the most deaths (65% for 5 million individuals vaccinated) and DALYs (40%) of strategies targeting by a single risk factor and targeting essential workers averted the least deaths (33%) and DALYs (25%) over the first 6 months of vaccine rollout. However, targeting by two or more risk factors simultaneously averted up to 40% more DALYs.

ConclusionsOur findings highlight the potential value of multiple-risk-factor targeting of COVID-19 vaccination. Where vaccine supply is limited and logistical challenges in vaccine delivery persist, age-based targeting offers a means of ensuring that vaccines reach those most at risk of poor health outcomes. If operational challenges can be overcome, more granular vaccination strategies that overlap age with other risk factors can be adopted.",NA,medrxiv

Based on initial data from the UK and later data from other countries, this variant was estimated to have a transmission fitness advantage of around 40-80% [1, 2, 3].

AimThis study aims to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time based on data from Switzerland.

MethodsWe generated whole genome sequences from 11.8% of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Switzerland between 14 December 2020 and 11 March 2021. Based on these data, we determine the daily frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant and quantify the variants transmission fitness advantage on a national and a regional scale.

ResultsWe estimate B.1.1.7 had a transmission fitness advantage of 43-52% compared to the other variants circulating in Switzerland during the study period. Further, we estimate B.1.1.7 had a reproductive number above 1 from 01 January 2021 until the end of the study period, compared to below 1 for the other variants. Specifically, we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was 1.24 [1.07-1.41] from 01 January until 17 January 2021 and 1.18 [1.06-1.30] from 18 January until 01 March 2021 based on the whole genome sequencing data. From 10 March to 16 March 2021, once B.1.1.7 was dominant, we estimate the reproductive number was 1.14 [1.00-1.26] based on all confirmed cases. For reference, Switzerland applied more non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat SARS-CoV-2 on 18 January 2021 and lifted some measures again on 01 March 2021.

ConclusionThe observed increase in B.1.1.7 frequency in Switzerland during the study period is as expected based on observations in the UK. In absolute numbers, B.1.1.7 increased exponentially with an estimated doubling time of around 2-3.5 weeks. To monitor the ongoing spread of B.1.1.7, our plots are available online.",NA,medrxiv

So far, the evidence has been generated in large, population-based settings. In contrast, the Quantified Self and Personal Science communities are composed of people interested in learning about themselves individually using their own data, often gathered via wearable devices.

ObjectiveWe explore how a co-creation process involving a heterogeneous community of personal science practitioners can develop a collective self-tracking system to monitor symptoms of infection alongside wearable sensor data.

MethodsWe engaged in a co-creation and design process with an existing community of personal science practitioners, jointly developing a working prototype of an online tool to perform symptom tracking. In addition to the iterative creation of the prototype (started on March 16, 2020), we performed a netnographic analysis, investigating the process of how this prototype was created in a decentralized and iterative fashion.

ResultsThe Quantified Flu prototype allows users to perform daily symptom reporting and is capable of visualizing those symptom reports on a timeline together with the resting heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate as measured by wearable devices. We observe a high level of engagement, with over half of the 92 users that engaged in the symptom tracking becoming regular users, reporting over three months of data each. Furthermore, our netnographic analysis highlights how the current Quantified Flu prototype is a result of an interactive and continuous co-creation process in which new prototype releases spark further discussions of features and vice versa.

ConclusionsAs shown by the high level of user engagement and iterative development, an open co-creation process can be successfully used to develop a tool that is tailored to individual needs, decreasing dropout rates.",NA,medrxiv

The study uses an agent-based simulation model that replicates community spread in an urban region of U.S.A. via daily social mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the models behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15 %) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.",NA,medrxiv

The Alpha variant is considered to possess higher transmissibility compared to the strains previously circulating in England. This paper proposes a new method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over another strain using the time course of strain frequencies and the distribution of the serial interval of infections. This method allows the instantaneous reproduction numbers of infections to vary over calendar time. The proposed method also assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant. Applying the method to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from England, the instantaneous reproduction number of the B.1.1.7 strain was estimated to be 26.6-45.9% higher than previously circulating strains in England. This result indicates that control measures should be strengthened by 26.6-45.9% when the B.1.1.7 strain is newly introduced to a country where viruses with similar transmissibility to the preexisting strain in England are predominant.",NA,medrxiv

To address this shortfall, we inoculated human volunteers with a clonal field isolate of P. vivax and tracked their response through infection and convalescence. High dimensional protein and RNA-seq data show that P. vivax triggers an acute phase response that shares remarkable overlap with that of P. falciparum, suggesting a hardwired emergency myeloid response that does not discriminate parasite species. We then used cytometry by time of flight to analyse the fate and function of innate-like and adaptive T cells; these data show that P. vivax can activate up to one quarter of the entire T cell compartment. Heterogeneous effector memory-like CD4+ T cells dominate this extraordinary response and phenotypic analysis reveals unexpected features of terminal differentiation that are normally associated with cytotoxicity and autoinflammatory disease. In line with this observation, we found that CD4+ T cell activation coincides with collateral tissue damage and liver injury. Finally, comparative analyses demonstrate that P. falciparum drives T cell activation far in excess of P. vivax, which may partially explain why falciparum malaria more frequently causes severe disease.",NA,medrxiv

Our study aimed to understand the willingness of health workers to receive COVID-19 vaccine and associated concerns across 10 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO).

MethodA cross-sectional study was conducted in January 2021 among healthcare workers using an online survey. A total of 2806 health workers (Physicians, Nurses and Pharmacists) completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. S

ResultsMore than half of the respondents (58.0%) were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccine, even if the vaccination is not mandatory for them. On the other hand, 25.7% of respondents were not willing to undertake COVID-19 vaccination while 16.3 % answered undecided. The top three reasons for not intending to be vaccinated were unreliability of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials (62.0%), fear of the side effects of the vaccine (45.3%), and that COVID-19 vaccine will not give immunity for a long period of time (23.1%).

ConclusionOverall, our study revealed suboptimal acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine among our respondents in the EMRO region.

MethodsWe measured SARS-CoV-2 infection in 320 learners [10.5 {+/-} 2.1(sd); 7-17 y.o.] at four diverse schools with either remote or on-site learning. Schools A and B served low-income Hispanic learners; school C served many special-needs learners; and all provided predominantly remote instruction. School D served middle- and upper-income learners, with predominantly on-site instruction. Testing occurred in the fall (2020), and 6-8 weeks later during the fall-winter surge (notable for a tenfold increase in COVID-19 cases). Immune responses and mitigation fidelity were also measured.

ResultsWe found SARS-CoV-2 infections in 17 learners only during the surge. School A (97% remote learners) had the highest infection (10/70, 14.3%, p<0.01) and IgG positivity rates (13/66, 19.7%).

Such targeting is potentially contentious, so rigorously quantifying its benefits and downsides is critical for designing effective and equitable pandemic control policies. We propose a flexible modeling framework and algorithms to compute optimally targeted interventions that coordinate across two dimensions of heterogeneity: age of different groups and the specific activities that individuals engage in during the course of a day. We showcase a complete implementation in a case study focused on the COVID-19 epidemic in the Ile-de-France region of France, based on hospitalization, community mobility, social contacts and economic data. We find that optimized dual-targeted policies generate substantial complementarities that lead to Pareto improvements, reducing the number of deaths and the economic losses overall and reducing the time in confinement for each age group, compared to less targeted interventions. These policies have a simple and explainable structure. Since dual-targeted policies could lead to increased discrepancies in the confinements faced by distinct groups, we also quantify the impact of requirements that explicitly limit such disparities, and find that satisfactory trade-offs may be achievable through limited targeting.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThis is a population-based and a microsimulation modelling study. Provincial administrative data from January 2019 to May 2021 was used to estimate the backlog size and wait-times following the COVID-19 pandemic. For the post-pandemic recovery phase, we estimated the resources required to clear the backlog of patients accumulated on the waitlist during the pandemic.

ResultsA total of 56,923 patients were on the waitlist in the province of Ontario awaiting non-emergency ophthalmic surgery as of March 15, 2020. The number of non-emergency surgeries performed in the province decreased by 45-98% from March to May 2020, and 48-80% from April to May 2021 compared to the same months in 2019.

In contrast to many other countries with epidemics, Japan differed in that it avoided lockdowns and instead asked people for self-control. A travel campaign was conducted with a sizable budget, but the number of PCR tests was severely limited. These choices may have influenced the course of the epidemic.

MethodsThe increase or decrease in the classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants was estimated by analyzing the published sequences with an objective multivariate analysis. This approach observes the samples in multiple directions, digesting complex differences into simpler forms. The results were compared over time with the number of confirmed cases, PCR tests, and overseas visitors. The kinetics of infection were analyzed using the logarithmic growth rate.

ResultsThe declared states of emergency failed to alter the movement of the growth rate. Three epidemic peaks were caused by domestically mutated variants. In other countries, there are few cases in which multiple variants have peaked. However, due to the relaxation of immigration restrictions, several infective variants have been imported from abroad and are currently competing for expansion, creating the fourth peak. By April 2021, these foreign variants exceeded 80%.

Deaths were several times higher in the worst-case CFR scenario. Each additional 9-16 (resp. 285-578) individuals who adopted NPIs in the first wave prevented one additional infection (resp., death). Our results show that the adoption of NPIs prevented a public health catastrophe. A less comprehensive approach, employing only closures or individual-level NPI adherence, would have resulted in a large number of cases and deaths.",NA,medrxiv

Here, we address this problem and explain the appearance of these patterns. We start with an empirical study of an original dataset obtained from highly precise measurements of SARS-Cov-2 concentration in wastewater over nine months in several treatment plants around the Thau lagoon in France. Among various features, we observe that the concentration displays plateaus at different dates in various locations but at the same level. In order to understand these facts, we introduce a new mathematical model that takes into account the heterogeneity and the natural variability of individual behaviours. Our model shows that the distribution of risky behaviours appears as the key ingredient for understanding the observed temporal patterns of epidemics.",NA,medrxiv

At the same time, a variety of functional autoantibodies have been observed in individuals with severe COVID-19 where they likely contribute to immunopathology. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which autoantibodies might target NETs in COVID-19 and, if detected, to elucidate their potential functions and clinical associations. We measured anti-NET antibodies in 328 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls. We found high anti-NET activity in the IgG and IgM fractions of 27% and 60% of patients, respectively. There was a strong correlation between anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM (r=0.4, p<0.0001). Both anti-NET IgG and IgM tracked with high levels of circulating NETs, impaired oxygenation efficiency, and high circulating D-dimer. Furthermore, patients who required mechanical ventilation had a greater burden of anti-NET antibodies than did those not requiring oxygen supplementation. Levels of anti-NET IgG (and to a lesser extent anti-NET IgM) demonstrated an inverse correlation with the efficiency of NET degradation by COVID sera. Furthermore, purified IgG from COVID sera with high levels of anti-NET antibodies impaired the ability of healthy control serum to degrade NETs. In summary, many individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 have anti-NET antibodies, which likely impair NET clearance and may potentiate SARS-CoV-2-mediated thromboinflammation.",NA,medrxiv

This defect can be explained in a subset of patients by the presence of circulating autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against IFN-I. We set out to improve the detection and the quantification of IFN-I auto-Abs in a cohort of critically-ill COVID-19 patients, in order to better evaluate the prevalence of these Abs as the pandemic progresses, and how they correlate with the clinical course of the disease.

MethodsThe concentration of anti-IFN-2 Abs was determined in the serum of 84 critically-ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted to ICU in Hospices Civils de Lyon, France using a commercially available kit (Thermo-Fisher, Catalog #BMS217).

ResultsA total of 21/84 (25%) critically-ill COVID-19 patients had circulating anti-IFN-2 Abs above cut-off (>34 ng.mL-1). Among them, 15/21 had Abs with neutralizing activity against IFN-, i.e. 15/84 (18%) of critically-ill patients. In addition, we noticed an impairment of the IFN-I response in the majority of patients with neutralizing anti-IFN-2 Abs. There was no significant difference in the clinical characteristics or outcome of with or without neutralizing anti-IFN-2 auto-Abs. We detected anti-IFN-2 auto-Abs in COVID-19 patients sera throughout their ICU stay. Finally, we also found auto-Abs against multiple subtypes of IFN-I including IFN-{omega}.

ConclusionsWe reported that 18% of critically-ill COVID-19 patients were positive for IFN-I auto-Abs, confirming the detrimental role of these Abs in the antiviral response.",NA,medrxiv

Residual mortality rates (RMR) in 2020 were calculated as excess mortality minus reported mortality rates due to Covid-19 where excess deaths were observed deaths in 2020 minus the average for 2015-2019. Differences in RMR are differences not attributed to reported Covid-19. For about half the countries, RMRs were negative and for half, positive. The absolute rates in some countries were double those in others. In a regression analysis, population density and proportion of female smokers were positively associated with both Covid-19 and excess mortality while the human development index and proportion of male smokers were negatively associated with both. RMR was not associated with any of the investigated variables. The results show that published data on mortality from Covid-19 cannot be directly comparable across countries. This may be due to differences in Covid-19 death reporting and in addition, the unprecedented public health measures implemented to control the pandemic may have produced either increased or reduced excess deaths due to other diseases. Further data on cause-specific mortality is required to determine the extent to which residual mortality represents non-Covid-19 deaths and to explain differences between countries.",NA,medrxiv

The vaccine delivers both the viral spike (S) protein modified to increase cell-surface expression (S-Fusion) and the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) to enhance MHC class I and II presentation and T-cell responses. The vaccine antigens are delivered using a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) platform with E1, E2b, and E3 regions deleted that has been shown in previous cancer vaccine studies to be effective in the presence of pre-existing hAd5 immunity. Here, we demonstrate the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD (hAd5 S + N) vaccine antigens when expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) of previously SARS-CoV-2-infected patients elicit Th1 dominant activation of autologous patient T cells, indicating the vaccine antigens have the potential for generating immune responses in patients previously infected or vaccinated. We further demonstrate that participants in our open-label Phase 1b study of the dual-antigen hAd5 S + N vaccine generate Th1 dominant S- and N-specific T cells after a single prime subcutaneous injection and that the magnitude of these responses were comparable to those seen for T cells from previously infected patients. We further present our in silico prediction of T-cell epitope HLA binding for both the first-wave SARS-CoV-2  A strain and the K417N, E484K, and N501Y S as well as the T201I N variants that suggests T-cell responses to the hAd5 S + N vaccine will retain efficacy against these variants. These findings that the dual-antigen hAd5 S + N vaccine elicits SARS-CoV-2-relevant T-cell responses and that such cell-mediated protection is likely to be sustained against emerging variants supports the testing of this vaccine as a universal booster that would enhance and broaden existing immune protection conferred by currently approved S-based vaccines.",NA,medrxiv

The effectiveness of vaccines in settings with widespread Gamma variant transmission has not been reported.

MethodsWe performed a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of an inactivated vaccine, CoronaVac, in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Manaus, where the Gamma variant accounted for 86% of genotyped SARS-CoV-2 samples at the peak of its epidemic. We performed an early analysis of effectiveness following administration of at least one vaccine dose and an analysis of effectiveness of the two-dose schedule. The primary outcome was symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

FindingsFor the early at-least-one-dose and two-dose analyses the study population was, respectively, 53,176 and 53,153 HCWs residing in Manaus and aged 18 years or older, with complete information on age, residence, and vaccination status. Among 53,153 HCWs eligible for the two-dose analysis, 47,170 (89%) received at least one dose of CoronaVac and 2,656 individuals (5%) underwent RT-PCR testing from 19 January, 2021 to 13 April, 2021. Of 3,195 RT-PCR tests, 885 (28%) were positive. 393 and 418 case- control pairs were selected for the early and two-dose analyses, respectively, matched on calendar time, age, and neighbourhood. Among those who had received both vaccine doses before the RT-PCR sample collection date, the average time from second dose to sample collection date was 14 days (IQR 7-24). In the early analysis, vaccination with at least one dose was associated with a 0.50-fold reduction (adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE), 49.6%, 95% CI 11.3 to 71.4) in the odds of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the first dose. However, we estimated low effectiveness (adjusted VE 36.8%, 95% CI -54.9 to 74.2) of the two-dose schedule against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the second dose. A finding that vaccinated individuals were much more likely to be infected than unvaccinated individuals in the period 0-13 days after first dose (aOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.36-3.27) suggests that unmeasured confounding led to downward bias in the vaccine effectiveness estimate.

InterpretationEvidence from this test-negative study of the effectiveness of CoronaVac was mixed, and likely affected by bias in this setting. Administration of at least one vaccine dose showed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of epidemic Gamma variant transmission. However, the low estimated effectiveness of the two-dose schedule underscores the need to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions while vaccination campaigns with CoronaVac are being implemented.

MethodsUsing pseudonymised data on 902,813 individuals continuously employed by 191 National Health Service trusts during 1.1.19 to 31.7.20, we explored demographic and occupational risk factors for sickness absence ascribed to Covid-19 during 9.3.20 to 31.7.20 (n = 92,880). We estimated odds ratios (ORs) by multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsWith adjustment for employing trust, demographic characteristics, and previous frequency of sickness absence, risk relative to administrative/clerical occupations was highest in additional clinical services (including care assistants) (OR 2.31 [2.25-2.37]), registered nursing and midwifery professionals (OR 2.28 [2.23-2.34]) and allied health professionals (OR 1.94 [1.88-2.01]), and intermediate in doctors and dentists (OR 1.55 [1.50-1.61]). Differences in risk were higher after the employing trust had started to care for documented Covid-19 patients, and were reduced, but not eliminated, following additional adjustment for exposure to infected patients or materials, assessed by a job-exposure matrix. For prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence (episodes lasting >14 days), the variation in risk by staff group was somewhat greater.

ConclusionsAfter allowance for possible bias and confounding by non-occupational exposures, we estimated that relative risks for Covid-19 among most patient-facing occupations were between 1.5 and 2.5. The highest risks were in those working in additional clinical services, nursing and midwifery and in allied health professions. Better protective measures for these staff groups should be a priority. Covid-19 may meet criteria for compensation as an occupational disease in some healthcare occupations.

Key messagesO_LIWhat is already known about this subject?
Healthcare workers and other keyworkers (workers whose job was considered essential to societal functioning) had a higher likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 than other workers during the first lockdown in England. Amongst healthcare workers, those working in inpatient settings had the highest rate of infection.
C_LIO_LIWhat are the new findings?
Between March and July 2000, the overall risk of COVID-19 sickness absence in National Health Service staff in England was lower at older ages, higher in non-white staff, and (in comparison with administrative and clerical staff) more than doubled in registered nurses and among workers such as healthcare assistants providing support to health professionals. Risk in health care scientists was little different from that in administrative and clerical occupations
C_LIO_LIHow might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
Our results suggest that the risk reduction strategies that were in place for healthcare scientists were effective. However, the protection for nursing and supporting health professionals was insufficient. In the event of a further  wave of infections resulting in high hospital admissions, attention should be paid to ensuring that risk reduction strategies for nurses and supporting health professionals are improved.

Here, we explore the neural correlates of ketamine-related changes in PTSD symptoms, using a rich battery of functional imaging data (two emotion-processing tasks and one task-free scan), collected from a subset of participants of a randomized clinical trial of repeated-dose intravenous ketamine vs midazolam (total N=21). In a pre-registered analysis, we tested whether changes in an a priori set of imaging measures from a target neural circuit were predictive of improvement in PTSD symptoms, using leave-one-out cross-validated elastic-net regression models (regions of interest in the target circuit consisted of the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior hippocampus, anterior insula, and amygdala). Improvements in PTSD severity were associated with increased functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala during emotional face-viewing (change score retained in model with minimum predictive error in left-out subjects, standardized regression coefficient [{beta}]=2.90). This effect was stronger in participants who received ketamine compared to midazolam (interaction {beta}=0.86), and persisted following inclusion of concomitant change in depressive symptoms in the analysis model ({beta}=0.69). Improvement following ketamine was also predicted by decreased dorsal anterior cingulate activity during emotional conflict regulation, and increased task-free connectivity between the vmPFC and anterior insula ({beta}s=-2.82, 0.60). Exploratory follow-up analysis via dynamic causal modelling revealed that whilst improvement in PTSD symptoms following either drug was associated with decreased excitatory modulation of amygdala[-&gt;]vmPFC connectivity during emotional face-viewing, increased top-down inhibition of the amygdala by the vmPFC was only observed in participants who improved under ketamine. Individuals with low prefrontal inhibition of amygdala responses to faces at baseline also showed greater improvements following ketamine treatment.

Antigen tests have recently emerged as a viable alternative to detect patients with high viral loads, associated with elevated risk of transmission. While rapid lateral flow tests greatly improved accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection in critical areas, their manual nature limits scalability and suitability for large-scale testing schemes. The Elecsys(R) SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay allows antigen immunoassays to be carried out on fully automated high-throughput serology platforms.

MethodsA total of 3139 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3 different testing sites in Germany. Swab samples were pre-characterized by RT-qPCR and consecutively subjected to the antigen immunoassay on either the cobas e 411 or cobas e 801 analyzers.

ResultsOf the tested respiratory samples, 392 were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Median concentration was 2.95x104 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.1x102-3.5x106) copies/mL. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the antigen immunoassay were 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.2-65.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100), respectively. A 93.7% (95% CI 89.7-96.5) sensitivity was achieved at a viral RNA concentration [&ge;]104 copies/mL ([~]cycle threshold (Ct) value<29.9).

ConclusionThe Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay reliably detected patient samples with viral loads of 10,000 copies/mL and higher. It thus represents a viable high-throughput alternative for screening of patients, or in situations where PCR testing is not readily available.

In Bangladesh a national lockdown implemented in March 2020 exacerbated poverty and was untenable long-term, and a resurgence in 2021 warranted renewed NPIs.

MethodsWe developed an SEIR model for Dhaka District, parameterised from literature values and calibrated to data from Bangladesh. We discussed scenarios and parameterisations with policymakers with the aid of an interactive app. These discussions guided modelling of lockdown and two post-lockdown measures considered feasible to deliver; symptoms-based household quarantining and compulsory mask-wearing. We examined how testing capacity affects case detection, and compared NPI scenarios on deaths, hospitalisations relative to capacity, working days lost, and cost-effectiveness.

ResultsLockdowns alone were predicted to delay the first epidemic peak but could not prevent overwhelming of the health service and were costly in lost working days. Impacts of post-lockdown interventions depended heavily on compliance. Assuming 80% compliance, symptoms-based household quarantining alone could not prevent hospitalisations exceeding capacity, whilst mask-wearing prevented overwhelming health services and was cost-effective given masks of high filtration efficiency. Combining masks with quarantine increased their impact. Even at maximum testing capacity, confirmed cases far underestimate total cases. Recalibration to surging cases in 2021 suggests potential for another wave later in 2021, dependent on uncertainties in case reporting and immunity.

ConclusionsMasks and symptoms-based household quarantining synergistically prevent transmission, and are cost-effective in Bangladesh. Our interactive app was valuable in supporting decision-making, with mask-wearing being mandated early, and community teams being deployed to support quarantining across Dhaka. These measures likely contributed to averting the worst public health impacts, but delivering an effective response at scale has been challenging. Messaging to increase compliance with mask-wearing and quarantine is needed to reduce the risk and impacts from another wave.",NA,medrxiv

Vaccination had a greater impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections with evidence of high viral shedding Ct<30 (88% reduction after two doses; 95% CI 80 to 93%; P<0.001) and with self-reported symptoms (90% reduction after two doses; 95% CI 82 to 94%; P<0.001); effects were similar for different gene positivity patterns.

ConclusionVaccination with a single dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, or two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, significantly reduced new SARS-CoV-2 infections in this large community surveillance study. Greater reductions in symptomatic infections and/or infections with a higher viral burden are reflected in reduced rates of hospitalisations/deaths, but highlight the potential for limited ongoing transmission from asymptomatic infections in vaccinated individuals.

ObjectiveTo test validities of the lipid hypothesis and our ""fat-soluble vitamin hypothesis""

ResultsAfter empirical exploration, we defined a ""fat-soluble vitamin variable"" (FSVV) as the sum of kilocalories/day (KC/d) of processed meat + red meat + fish + milk + poultry + eggs + (saturated fatty acids (SFA) + polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) + trans fatty acids (TFA)) * 0.46. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) correlated strongly positively with FSVV worldwide (r=0.780, 95% CI 0.771 to 0.788, p<0001, n=7846 cohorts), so we considered FSVV our marker variable to test the lipid hypothesis and our fat-soluble vitamin hypothesis.

Conclusion and RelevanceSince FSVV correlated positively with CVD only in high FSVV cohorts, the lipid hypothesis was supported only in GBD cohorts (and by inference individuals) with high FSVV intake.

These worldwide data supported the fat-soluble vitamins hypothesis because FSVV correlated negatively with CVD, meaning the more fat-soluble vitamin containing animal foods and added fat for gut absorption the less the CVD. A moderate intake of FSVV foods, not yet precisely quantified, is predicted to contribute to reducing CVD. This GBD cohort data analysis methodology could supplement prospective observational studies of individuals to be used in developing food policy and education strategies for improving public health.

In the setting of NF1, this cancer type frequently arises from within its common and benign precursor, plexiform neurofibroma (PN). Transformation from PN to MPNST is challenging to diagnose due to difficulties in distinguishing cross-sectional imaging results and intralesional heterogeneity resulting in biopsy sampling errors.

Methods and FindingsThis multi-institutional study from the National Cancer Institute and Washington University in St. Louis used fragment size analysis and ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to distinguish between MPNST and PN in patients with NF1. Following in-silico enrichment for short cfDNA fragments and copy number analysis to estimate the fraction of plasma cfDNA originating from tumor (tumor fraction), we developed a noninvasive classifier which differentiates MPNST from PN with 86% pre-treatment accuracy (91% specificity, 75% sensitivity), and 89% accuracy on serial analysis (91% specificity, 83% sensitivity). Healthy controls without NF1 (subjects = 16, plasma samples = 16), PN (subjects = 23, plasma samples = 23), and MPNST (subjects = 14, plasma samples = 46) cohorts showed significant differences in tumor fraction in plasma (P = 0.001 as well as cfDNA fragment length (P < 0.001) with MPNST samples harboring shorter fragments and being enriched for tumor-derived cfDNA relative to PN and healthy controls. Mutational analysis demonstrated focal NF1 copy number loss in PN and MPNST patient plasma but not in healthy controls. Greater genomic instability including alterations associated with malignant transformation (focal copy number gains in chromosome arms 1q, 7p, 8q, 9q, and 17q; focal copy number losses in SUZ12, SMARCA2, CDKN2A/B, and chromosome arms 6p and 9p) was more prominently observed in MPNST plasma. Furthermore, the sum of longest tumor diameters (SLD) visualized by cross-sectional imaging correlated significantly with paired tumor fractions in plasma from MPNST patients (r = 0.39, P = 0.024). On serial analysis, tumor fraction levels in plasma dynamically correlated with treatment response to therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection before relapse. Study limitations include a modest MPNST sample size despite accrual from two major referral centers for this rare malignancy, and lack of uniform treatment and imaging protocols representing a real-world cohort.

ConclusionsTumor fraction levels derived from cfDNA fragment size and copy number alteration analysis of plasma cfDNA using ULP-WGS significantly correlated with MPNST tumor burden, accurately distinguished MPNST from its benign PN precursor, and dynamically correlated with treatment response. In the future, our findings could form the basis for improved early cancer detection and monitoring in high-risk cancer-predisposed populations.

Author summaryO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABS[tpltrtarr] Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is the most common inherited cancer predisposition syndrome.
[tpltrtarr]The leading cause of mortality in NF1 is malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that arises from a benign plexiform neurofibroma (PN) precursor lesion.
[tpltrtarr]Transformation from PN to MPNST is challenging to detect by imaging (due to difficulty in distinguishing PN from MPNST radiologically) or by biopsy (due to intralesional heterogeneity), which often delays the diagnosis of MPNST and results in a worsened prognosis.


What did the researchers do and find?[tpltrtarr] We conducted a multi-institutional study involving two large NF1 referral centers, the National Cancer Institute and Washington University in St. Louis, involving 73 patients from whom plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was analyzed using ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS).
We found that cfDNA from patients with MPNST harbors a shorter fragmentation profile compared to patients with PN or healthy donors. Using sequencing reads from this fragmentation profile, we quantified genome-wide copy number alterations (CNAs) in cfDNA and used CNAs to estimate the fraction of plasma cfDNA originating from tumor.
[tpltrtarr]Tumor fraction in plasma cfDNA distinguished pre-treatment MPSNT from PN with 86% accuracy. Plasma cfDNA from MPNST and PN patients harbored focal copy number loss of NF1, not found in healthy donors. Strikingly, MPNST patient cfDNA also had significantly greater tumor genomic instability compared to PN, with copy number alterations in key genomic loci previously observed in MPNST tissue (i.e., gain of chromosome arm 8q and loss of 9p), which enabled sensitive and specific liquid biopsy discrimination of MPNST from PN.
[tpltrtarr]Plasma-derived tumor fraction correlated with tumor size from imaging in MPNST patients, and serial cfDNA analysis demonstrated the potential for noninvasive detection of minimal residual disease, treatment response assessment, and the potential for even greater assay sensitivity.


What do these findings mean?[tpltrtarr] Our findings suggest that cfDNA fragment analysis followed by ULP-WGS has the potential to be developed as a biomarker for treatment response, and as a screening assay for early detection of MPNST.
[tpltrtarr]This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence for the ability of liquid biopsy to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors in a heritable cancer predisposition syndrome.",NA,medrxiv

We hypothesised that the early, strict lockdown which restricted individuals movements in Uganda limited access to services.

MethodsAn observational study, using routinely collected data from Electronic Medical Records was carried out, in Kawempe district, Kampala. An interrupted time series analysis assessed the impact on maternal, neonatal, child, sexual and reproductive health services from July 2019 to December 2020. Descriptive statistics summarised the main outcomes before (July 2019 - March 2020), during (April 2020 - June 2020) and after the national lockdown (July 2020 - December 2020).

ResultsBetween 1st July 2019 and 31st December 2020 there were 14,401 antenatal clinic attendances, 33,499 deliveries, 111,658 childhood service attendances and 57,174 for sexual health. All antenatal and vaccination services ceased in lockdown for four weeks. During the three-month lockdown, the number of antenatal attendances significantly decreased, and remain below pre-COVID levels (370 fewer/month). Attendances for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV dropped then stabilised. Increases during lockdown and immediately postlockdown included the number of women treated for high blood pressure, eclampsia and pre-eclampsia (218 more/month), adverse pregnancy outcomes (stillbirths, low-birth-weight and premature infant births), the rate of neonatal unit admissions, neonatal deaths and abortions. Maternal mortality remained stable. Immunisation clinic attendance declined whilst neonatal death rate rose (from 39-49/1000 livebirths). The number of children treated for pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria decreased during lockdown.

ConclusionThe Ugandan response to COVID-19 negatively impacted maternal, child and neonatal health, with an increase seen in pregnancy complications, and fetal and infant outcomes, likely due to delayed care-seeking behaviour. Decreased vaccination clinic attendance leaves a cohort of infants unprotected, affecting all vaccine-preventable diseases. Future pandemic responses must consider impacts of movement restrictions and access to preventative services to protect maternal and child health.

What are the new findings?O_LIAntenatal attendances decreased dramatically in April, followed by increased numbers low-birthweight infants and neonatal deaths.
C_LIO_LINewborn immunisations against polio, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae, rotavirus and pneumococcus decreased significantly.
C_LIO_LISexual, and reproductive health services were reduced in number.
C_LI

We investigated changes in depression and anxiety symptoms (overall and severe) from before to during the pandemic, as well as whether these changes are linked to COVID-19 related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities in young adults followed in the context of a population-based cohort.

MethodParticipants (n=1039) from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development reported on their depression and anxiety symptoms and completed a COVID-19 questionnaire during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020 (age 22 years). Assessments at age 20 (2018) were used to estimate pre-pandemic depression and anxiety symptom severity.

ResultsWhile overall levels of depression and anxiety symptoms did not change, there was an increase in rates of severe depression (but not severe anxiety) from before (6.1%) to during (8.2%) the pandemic. Depressive and anxiety symptoms increased from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic among young adults with the lowest levels of symptoms before the pandemic, while they decreased among those with the highest levels of pre-existing symptoms. Youth who were living alone experienced an increase in depressive symptoms. Other COVID-19 related variables (e.g., loss of education/occupation, frequent news-seeking) and pre-existing vulnerabilities (e.g., low SES, low social support) were not associated with changes in depression or anxiety symptoms.

ConclusionDepression and anxiety symptoms in young adults from Quebec in Summer 2020 were comparable to symptoms reported in 2018. Most COVID-19 related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities were not associated with changes in symptoms. However, the increased rate of severe depression and the increase in depression and anxiety symptoms among young adults with the least mental health symptoms before the COVID-19 pandemic are concerning.",NA,medrxiv

We evaluated 254 COVID-19 patients longitudinally from early infection and for eight months thereafter and found a predominant broad-based immune memory response. SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing antibodies exhibited a bi-phasic decay with an extended half-life of >200 days suggesting the generation of longer-lived plasma cells. In addition, there was a sustained IgG+ memory B cell response, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure. Polyfunctional virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also generated and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days. Interestingly, the CD4+ T cell response equally targeted several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whereas the CD8+ T cell response preferentially targeted the nucleoprotein, highlighting the importance of including the nucleoprotein as a potential vaccine antigen.

More than one million viral sequences are publicly available as of April 2021. Many studies estimate viral genealogies from these sequences, as these can provide valuable information about the spread of the pandemic across time and space. Additionally such data are a rich source of information about molecular evolutionary processes including natural selection, for example allowing the identification of new variants with transmissibility and immunity evasion advantages, and allowing the investigation of viral spread. To validate new methods and to verify results obtained from these vast datasets, one needs an efficient simulator able to simulate the pandemic to approximate world-scale scenarios and generate viral genealogies of millions of samples. Here, we introduce a new fast simulator VGsim which addresses this problem. The simulation process is split into two phases. During the forward run the algorithm generates a chain of events reflecting the dynamics of the pandemic using an hierarchical version of the Gillespie algorithm. During the backward run a coalescent-like approach generates a tree genealogy of samples conditioning on the events chain generated during the forward run.

Here we employ a targeted single-cell multi-omics approach, combining protein and mRNA quantification, to generate a high-resolution map of the T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell populations in blood from SLE patients.

MethodsWe designed a custom panel to quantify the transcription of 534 genes in parallel with the expression of 51 surface protein targets using the BD Rhapsody AbSeq single-cell system. We applied this technology to profile 20,656 T and NK cells isolated from peripheral blood from an SLE patient with a type I interferon (IFN)-induced gene expression signature (IFNhi), and an age- and sex- matched IFNlow SLE patient and healthy donor.

ResultsWe confirmed the presence of a rare cytotoxic CD4+ T cell (CTL) subset, which was exclusively present in the IFNhi patient. Furthermore, we identified additional alterations consistent with increased immune activation in this patient, most notably a shift towards terminally differentiated CD57+ CD8+ T cell and CD16+ NKdim phenotypes, and the presence of a subset of recently-activated naive CD4+ T cells.

ConclusionsOur results identify IFN-driven changes in the composition and phenotype of T and NK cells that are consistent with a systemic immune activation within the IFNhi patient, and underscore the added resolving power of this multi-omics approach to identify rare immune subsets. Consequently, we were able to find evidence for novel cellular peripheral biomarkers of SLE disease activity, including a subpopulation of CD57+ CD4+ CTLs.",NA,medrxiv

Acetylcholine modulates the acute inflammatory response through a neuro-immune mechanism known as the inflammatory reflex. Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor, increases the half-life of endogenous ACh, chemically stimulating the inflammatory reflex. This trial aimed to evaluate whether pyridostigmine could decrease invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death in patients with severe COVID-19.

MethodsWe performed a parallel-group, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate if add-on pyridostigmine to standard treatment reduced the composite outcome of initiation of IMV and 28-day all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

Results188 participants were randomly assigned to placebo (n=94) or pyridostigmine (n=94). The composite outcome occurred in 22 (23.4%) vs. 11 (11.7%) participants, respectively (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.96, p=0.03). Most of the adverse events were mild to moderate, with no serious adverse events related to pyridostigmine; discontinuation of the study drugs was similar in both groups.

ConclusionsWe provide evidence indicating that the addition of pyridostigmine to standard treatment resulted in a clinically significant reduction in the composite outcome (IMV/death) among patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19.

Randomized trials are lacking on patient-centered outcomes. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients receiving ketamine as an adjunct analgosedative with those receiving standard of care (SOC) alone. We also described the feasibility during COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsIn this randomized, open-label trial either ketamine or SOC, in a 1:1 ratio, was administered to patients who were intubated within 24 hours (medical, surgical, or transplant/oncology ICUs), expected to require mechanical ventilation (MV) for the next calendar day, and had the institutional pain and sedation protocol initiated. Ketamine infusion was 2 g/kg/min on day 1 and 1 g/kg/min on day 2. The primary outcome was the 28-day MV duration and ventilator-free days as co-primary outcome. Cox-proportional regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with probability for weaning off MV.

ResultsA total of 83 patients (43 in SOC and 40 in ketamine) were included. Demographics were balanced between the groups. The median duration of MV was not significantly different between the groups [median (interquartile range): 7 (3-9.25) for ketamine and 5 (2-8) for SOC, p= 0.15]. The median ventilation-free days was 19 days (IQR 0-24.75) in the ketamine and 19 days (IQR 0-24) in the SOC (p=0.70). Surgical and transplant/oncology ICU patients had a higher probability of weaning off MV than those in medical ICU [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.09 (1.06-4.14) for surgical ICU, 2.11 (1.02-4.35) for transplant/oncology ICU]. More patient was at goal RASS in ketamine compared to SOC. The sedatives and vasopressors cumulative doses were similar between the two arms at 48 hours. We found no difference in 28-day mortality rate, ICU and hospital length of stay, and hemodynamic changes. The consent rate was adequate and the protocol adherence rate was 97.5%.

ConclusionsKetamine as an adjunct agent for sedation did not decrease the duration of MV and appeared to be safe, feasible, and effective in subgroups of ICU patients. No effect was noted in sedative and pressors requirements, or on hemodynamics.

We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma (P.1) variant.

MethodsBy May 27, 2021, 147238,414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 70-79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19 and to other causes, as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0-69 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1-19, 2021.

FindingsThe proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19, whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for individuals aged 70-79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-69 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 5.0 times in week 19. Vaccination coverage (first dose) of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged 80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70-79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1-4, compared to 36.5% and 53.3% in weeks 15-19, respectively.

InterpretationRapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 43,802 COVID-related deaths would have been expected up to week 19.",NA,medrxiv

Miro Health is a mobile platform for the self-administration of sensor-based cognitive and behavioral assessments that was developed to measure factors typical of legacy neuropsychological tests in addition to behaviors that are currently left to subjective clinical impression such as eye movement, language, and processing speed.

ObjectiveStudies were conducted to measure Miro Healths concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and amnestic MCI classification performance.

MethodSpearman correlations were calculated to estimate the concurrent validity of Miro Health variables with legacy neuropsychological test variables using data from 160 study participants. Fifty-nine healthy controls were assessed at three time points to evaluate the test-retest reliability of Miro Health scores. Reliability was quantified with the scores intraclass correlations. Learning effects were measured as trends. In addition, a machine learning algorithm combined Miro Health variable scores into a Risk Score designed to distinguish 65 healthy controls (HC), 38 MCI participants (21 amnestic MCI (aMCI), and 17 non-amnestic MCI (naMCI)).

ResultsSignificant correlations of Miro Health variables with legacy neuropsychological test variables were observed. Longitudinal studies show agreement of subsequent measurements and minimal learning effects. The Risk Score distinguished aMCI from healthy controls with an Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) of 0.97; the naMCI participants and controls were separated with an AUROC of 0.80, and the combined MCI group (aMCI + naMCI) was separated from healthy controls with an AUROC of 0.89.

In fact, COVID-19 autopsy reports have shown widespread thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by extensive diffuse microthrombi within peripheral capillaries and arterioles in lungs, hearts, and other organs, resulting in multiorgan failure. However, the underlying process of COVID-19-associated microvascular thrombosis remains elusive due to the lack of tools to statistically examine platelet aggregation (i.e., the initiation of microthrombus formation) in detail. Here we present a method for massive image-based profiling, temporal monitoring, and big data analysis of circulating platelets and platelet aggregates in the blood of COVID-19 patients at single-cell resolution, to provide previously unattainable insights into the disease.

Furthermore, results indicate strong links between the concentration of platelet aggregates and the severity, mortality, and respiratory condition of patients with COVID-19. Finally, high-dimensional analysis based on deep learning shows that the disease behaves as systemic thrombosis.",NA,medrxiv

While initial reporting focused mainly on lung involvement, the ongoing pandemic showed that multiple organs can be involved, and prognosis is largely influenced by multi-organ involvement. Our aim was to obtain nationwide retrospective population-based data on hospitalizations with COVID-19 and AKI.

Materials & MethodsWe performed a query of G-DRG data for the year 2020 via the Institute for the hospital remuneration system (Institut fur das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus GmbH, InEK) data portal and therefore included hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of RT-PCR proven COVID-19 infection, aged over 15 years. We included hospitalizations with acute kidney injury (AKI) stages 1 to 3. Age-specific and age-standardized hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates (ASR) per 100.000 person years were calculated, with the German population of 2011 as the standard.

ResultsIn 2020, there were 16.776.845 hospitalizations in German hospitals. We detected 154.170 hospitalizations with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 diagnosis. The age-standardized hospitalization rate for COVID-19 in Germany was 232,8 per 100.000 person years (95% CI 213,6-233,9). The highest proportion of hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 were in the age group over 80 years. AKI was diagnosed in 16.773 (10,9%) of the hospitalizations with COVID-19. The relative risk of AKI for males was 1,49 (95%CI 1,44-1,53) compared to females. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was performed in 3.443 hospitalizations, 20,5% of the hospitalizations with AKI. For all hospitalizations with COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality amounted to 19,7% (n= 30.300). The relative risk for in-hospital mortality was 3,87 (95%CI 3,80-3,94) when AKI occurred. The age-standardized hospitalization rates for COVID-19 took a bimodal course during the observation period. The first peak occurred in April (ASR 23,95 per 100.000 person years (95%CI 23,58-24,33)), hospitalizations peaked again in November 2020 (72,82 per 100.000 person years (95%CI 72,17-73,48)). The standardized rate ratios (SRR) for AKI and AKI-related mortality with the overall ASR for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the denominator, actually decreased throughout the observation period and remained lower in autumn than they were in spring. In contrast to all COVID-19 hospitalizations, the SRR for overall mortality in COVID-19 hospitalizations diverged from hospitalizations with AKI in autumn 2020.

DiscussionOur study for the first time provides nationwide data on COVID-19 related hospitalizations and acute kidney injury in Germany in 2020. AKI was a frequent complication and associated with high mortality. We observed a less pronounced increase in the ASR for AKI-related mortality during autumn 2020. The proportion of AKI-related mortality in comparison to the overall mortality decreased throughout the course of the pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWhole genome sequencing was carried out on diagnostic sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs from 373 patients with COVID-19. Molecular clock phylogenetic analysis was undertaken to further explore dominant lineages.

ResultsThe B.1.411 lineage was most prevalent, which was established in Sri Lanka and caused outbreaks throughout the country until March 2021. The estimated time of the most recent common ancestor of this lineage was 29th June 2020 (95% lower and upper bounds 23rd May to 30th July), suggesting cryptic transmission may have occurred, prior to a large epidemic starting in October 2020. Returning travellers were identified with infections caused by lineage B.1.258, as well as the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage, which has replaced B.1.411 to fuel the ongoing large outbreak in the country.

ConclusionsThe large outbreak that started in early October, is due to spread of a single virus lineage, B.1.411 until the end of March 2021, when B.1.1.7 emerged and became the dominant lineage.",NA,medrxiv

In an effort to address these limitations, we performed a genetic meta-analysis of ALL in 76,317 participants across four ethnic groups, including 17,814 non-European individuals and 3,482 total cases. We replicated 15 out of 16 previously identified loci associated with ALL in our trans-ethnic analysis. We further identified five novel associations at genome-wide significance, including three novel loci and two secondary associations at previously known loci (17q12 and near CEBPE). The three putatively novel loci (rs9376090 near MYB/HBS1L, rs10998283 near TET1, and rs9415680 near JMJD1C/NRBF2) were previously shown to be associated with multiple blood cell traits and other hematopoietic cancers. Polygenic risk scores constructed from our trans-ethnic meta-analysis showed similar efficacy in independent Latino (LAT) and non-Latino white (NLW) ALL cohorts (AUC [~] 0.67-0.68) and could partly explain the increased risk of ALL in LAT compared to NLW. Cross-population analysis also showed high but significantly less than 100% genetic correlation between LAT and NLW, suggesting potential differences in the underlying genetic architecture between ethnic groups. In summary, our findings enhance the understanding of genetic contribution to ALL risk across diverse populations and highlight the importance to include multiple ethnic groups in GWAS.

MethodsThe ELISA (Lubeck Longitudinal Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection) study invited adult inhabitants (n=[~]300,000) from the Lubeck area (Northern Germany) and enrolled 3051 participants ([~]1%); 1929 population-matched and 1645 with high-exposure based on profession. The one-year study period (03/2020-02/2021) spanned massive influx of tourism in the summer, rise of infection rates in the fall/winter 2020/2021, and two lockdowns. Participants were screened seven times for SARS-CoV-2 infection using PCR and antibody testing and monitored with an app-based questionnaire (n=[~]91,000).

ResultsCohort (56% female; mean age: 45.6 years) retention was 75%-98%; 89 persons (3.5%) were antibody- and/or PCR-positive. Seropositivity was almost 2-fold higher in men and increased risk detected in several high-exposure groups (highest for nurses, followed by police, army, firemen, and students). In May 2020, 92% of the infections were missed by PCR testing; by February 2021, only 29% remained undiagnosed. ""Contact to COVID-19-affected"" was the most relevant risk factor. Other factors, such as frequent use of public transportation, shopping, close contacts at work, and extensive tourism in the summer did not impact infection rates.

ConclusionsWe i) provide a model for effective, regional surveillance; ii) identify infection risk factors informing public health measures; iii) demonstrate that easing of lockdown measures appears safe at times of low prevalence in the presence of continuous monitoring.",NA,medrxiv

Years of life lost is therefore widely used as a more relevant metric, however, such calculations in the context of COVID-19 are all biased upwards: patients dying from COVID-19 are typically multimorbid, having far worse life expectation than the general population. These questions are quantitatively investigated using a unique Hungarian dataset that contains individual patient level data on comorbidities for all COVID-19 deaths in the country. To account for the comorbidities of the patients, a parametric survival model using 11 important long-term conditions was used to estimate a more realistic years of life lost. As of 12 May, 2021, Hungary reported a total of 27,837 deaths from COVID-19 in patients above 50 years of age. The usual calculation indicates 10.5 years of life lost for each death, which decreases to 9.2 years per death after adjusting for 11 comorbidities. The expected number of years lost implied by the life table, reflecting the mortality of a developed country just before the pandemic is 11.1 years. The years of life lost due to COVID-19x in Hungary is therefore 12% or 1.3 years per death lower when accounting for the comorbidities and is below its expected value, but how this should be interpreted is still a matter of debate. Further research is warranted on how to optimally integrate this information into epidemiologic risk assessments during a pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

The aim of this study was to determine the incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability - defined by the number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes - in predicting the risk of escalation of care towards hospital referral in primary care patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

MethodsData were retrospectively collected from three large Dutch primary care registries with routine care data of {+/-}850,000 people. A prognostic prediction model was developed in two databases to assess the incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability. Data from the  first wave of COVID-19 infections in the Netherlands (March 1 2020 to June 1 2020) was used for derivation. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predict hospital referral within 90 days follow-up after first consultation in consecutive adult patients seen in primary care for COVID-19 symptoms. Age, sex, the interaction between age and sex, and the number of underlying cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes (0, 1, or [&ge;]2) were pre-specified as predictors prior to the analyses. The model was (i) compared to a simpler model without the predictor number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes and (ii) externally validated in COVID-19 confirmed patients during the  second wave (June 1 2020 to April 15 2021) in all three databases.

ResultsThere were 5,475 patients included for model development and 6.8% had the primary outcome hospital referral. The model with number of cardiovascular diseases included as a predictor performed better than a model without this predictor (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). Older male patients with multiple cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes had the highest predicted risk of hospital referral, reaching risks above 15-20% in these patients. The model was externally validated in a population of 16,693 COVID-19 patients. The observed risk was lower in this temporal validation cohort (4.7% versus 6.8%). The temporally validated c-statistic was 0.747 (95%CI 0.729-0.764) and the model showed good calibration.

ConclusionIn this general population study, risk of clinical deterioration after suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was on average 5.1% in the development and validation cohorts combined. This risk increased with age and was higher in males compared to females. Importantly, patients with concurrent cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes had higher predicted risks. Identifying those at risk for hospital referral could have clinical implications for COVID-19 early disease management in primary care.",NA,medrxiv

RESULTSFour-hundred fifty-seven (457) and 1365 patients were randomized and treated in phases 2 and 3, respectively. Among phase 3 critical patients receiving MV (n=289; 34.3% on corticosteroids), the proportion with [&ge;]1-point improvement in clinical status (alive not receiving MV) at day 22 was 43.2% in sarilumab 400 mg and 35.5% in placebo (risk difference [RD] +7.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.4 to 21.3; P=0.3261), representing a relative risk improvement of 21.7%. Day 29 all-cause mortality was 36.4% in sarilumab 400 mg versus 41.9% in placebo (RD -5.5%; 95% CI, -20.2 to 8.7; relative risk reduction 13.3%). In post hoc analyses pooling phase 2 and 3 critical patients receiving MV, the hazard ratio (HR) for death in sarilumab 400 mg compared with placebo was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.13) overall, improving to 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.94) in patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline.

CONCLUSIONIn hospitalized patients with Covid-19 receiving MV, numerical benefits with sarilumab did not achieve statistical significance, but benefit may be greater in patients receiving corticosteroids. A larger study is required to confirm this observed numerical benefit.

MethodsVirus Watch is a large community cohort with prospective daily recording of a wide range of symptoms and self-reporting of swab results (mainly undertaken through the UK TTI system). We compared frequency, severity, timing, and duration of symptoms in test positive and test negative cases. We compared the test performance of the current UK case definition used by TTI (any one of: new continuous cough, high temperature, or loss of or altered sense of smell or taste) with a wider definition that also included muscle aches, chills, headache, or loss of appetite.

FindingsWe included results from 8213 swabbed illnesses, 944 of which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All symptoms were more common in test positive than test negative illnesses and symptoms were also more severe and of longer duration. Common symptoms such as cough, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, and loss of appetite occurred early in the course of illness but were also very common in test-negative illnesses. In contrast, high temperature and loss of or altered sense of smell or taste were less frequently identified in swab positive illnesses but were markedly more common than in swab negative illnesses. The current UK definition had a sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 47% respectively for symptomatic COVID-19 compared to 93% and 26% for the broader definition. On average, cases met the broader case definition 0.3 days earlier than the current definition. 1.7-fold more illnesses met the broader definition than the current case definition.

InterpretationCOVID-19 is difficult to distinguish from other respiratory infections and common ailments on the basis of symptoms. Broadening the list of symptoms used to encourage engagement with TTI could moderately increase the number of infections identified and shorten delays to isolation, but with a large increase in the number of tests needed and the number of unwell individuals and contacts who are advised to self-isolate whilst awaiting results, and subsequently test negative for SARS-CoV-2.",NA,medrxiv

A RT-qPCR screening and phylogenomics reconstructions directed a sequence/structure analysis of the Spike glycoprotein, revealing mutation of concern E484K in genomes from central Mexico, in addition to the nationwide prevalence of the imported variant 20C/S:452R (B.1.427/9). Overall, the detected variants in Mexico show Spike protein mutations in the N-terminal domain (i.e., R190M), in the receptor-binding motif (i.e., T478K, E484K), within the S1-S2 subdomains (i.e., P681R/H, T732A), and at the basis of the protein, V1176F, raising concerns about the lack of phenotypic and clinical data available for the variants of interest (VOI) we postulate: 20B/478K.V1 (B.1.1.222 or B.1.1.519) and 20B/P.4 (B.1.1.28.4). Moreover, the population patterns of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) from symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers obtained with a self-sampling scheme confirmed the presence of several fixed variants, and differences in allelic frequencies among localities. We identified the mutation N:S194L of the Nucleocapsid protein associated with symptomatic patients. Phylogenetically, this mutation is frequent in Mexican sub-clades, so we propose an additional VOI, 20A/N:194L.V2 (B.1.243). Our results highlight the dual and complementary role of Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins in adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to their hosts and provide a baseline for specific follow-up of mutations of concern during the vaccination stage.

IMPACT STATEMENTFollowing self-sampling, screening of mutations of concern, and a combined phylogenomic and population genetics pipeline, we reveal the appearance of three VOI with mutations in the Spike protein, P.4 (B.1.1.28.4) and 20B/478K.V1 (B.1.1.222, leading to B.1.1.519), and in the Nucleocapsid protein, 20A/N:194L.V2 (B.1.243), in Mexico during the pre-vaccination stage. The mutation S194L in the Nucleocapsid was found to associate with symptomatic patients versus asymptomatic carriers in the population investigated. Our research can aid epidemiological genomics efforts during the vaccination stage in Mexico by contributing with a combined analytical platform and information about variants within different genetic lineages with the potential to evolve into variants of concern (VOC).",NA,medrxiv

BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic led to systemic change within healthcare settings and demands placed on frontline nurses has been overwhelming. Lessons learned from previous pandemics indicate that clear communication and strong visible leadership can mitigate the impact stressful events may have on nurses. Conversely, a lack of clear leadership and regulatory protocols in times of crisis can lead to an increase in psychological distress for nurses.

DesignSecondary analysis of semi-structured interview transcripts.

MethodsSecondary data analysis was conducted on data collected during a hospital-wide evaluation of barriers and facilitators to changes implemented to support the surge of COVID-19 related admissions in wave one of the pandemic. Participants represented three-levels of leadership: whole trust (n=17), division (n=7), ward/department-level (n=8), and individual nurses (n=16). Data were collected through semi-structured video interviews between May and July 2020. Interviews were analysed using Framework analysis.

ResultsKey changes that were implemented in wave one reported at whole trust level included: a new acute staffing level, redeploying nurses, increasing the visibility of nursing leadership, new staff wellbeing initiatives, new roles created to support families and various training initiatives. Two main themes emerged from the interviews at division, ward/department and individual nurse level: impact of leadership, and impact on the delivery of nursing care.

ConclusionsLeadership through a crisis is essential for the protective effect of nurses emotional wellbeing. While nursing leadership was made more visible during wave one of the pandemic and processes were in place to increase communication, system-level challenges resulting in negative experiences existed. By identifying these challenges, it has been possible to overcome them during wave two by employing different leadership styles, to support nurse wellbeing",NA,medrxiv

MethodsNasopharyngeal swabs, surface, and air samples were collected from the rooms of 78 inpatients with COVID-19 at six acute care hospitals in Toronto from March to May 2020. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and cultured to determine potential infectivity. Whole viral genomes were sequenced from nasopharyngeal and surface samples. Association between patient factors and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in surface samples were investigated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model.

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from surfaces (125/474 samples; 42/78 patients) and air (3/146 samples; 3/45 patients) in COVID-19 patient rooms; 17% (6/36) of surface samples from three patients yielded viable virus. Viral sequences from nasopharyngeal and surface samples clustered by patient.

Multivariable analysis indicated hypoxia at admission, a PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swab with a cycle threshold of [&le;]30 on or after surface sampling date, higher Charlson co-morbidity score, and shorter time from onset of illness to sample date were significantly associated with detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in surface samples.

InterpretationThe infrequent recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus from the environment suggests that the risk to healthcare workers from air and near-patient surfaces in acute care hospital wards is likely limited. Surface contamination was greater when patients were earlier in their course of illness and in those with hypoxia, multiple co-morbidities, and higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in NP swabs. Our results suggest that air and surfaces may pose limited risk a few days after admission to acute care hospitals.",NA,medrxiv

In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed 12 comorbidities within the first tier that increase with the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including the comorbidities that are common with increasing age (referred to as age-related comorbidities) and other comorbidities. However, the current method compares a population with and without a particular disease (or disorder), which may result in a bias on the results. Thus, comorbidity risks of COVID-19 mortality may be underestimated.

ObjectiveTo re-evaluate the mortality data from US States and estimate the odds ratios of death by major comorbidities with COVID-19, we incorporated the control population with no comorbidity reported and assessed the risk of COVID-19 mortality with comorbidity.

MethodsWe collected all the comorbidity data from the Public Health websites of fifty US States and Washington DC accessed on December 2020. The timing of the data collection should allow minimizing a bias from the COVID-19 vaccines and new COVID-19 variants. The comorbidity demographic data were extracted from the State Public Health data made available online. Using the inverse-variance random-effects model, we performed a comparative analysis and estimated the odds ratio of deaths by COVID-19 with pre-existing comorbidities.

ResultsA total of 39,451 COVID-19 deaths were identified from four States that had comorbidity data, including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York. 92.8% of the COVID-19 deaths were associated with pre-existing comorbidity. The risk of mortality associated with at least one comorbidity combined was 1,113 times higher than that with no comorbidity. The comparative analysis identified nine comorbidities with odds ratios of up to 35 times significantly higher than no comorbidities. Of them, the top four comorbidities were: hypertension (odds ratio 34.73; 95% CI 3.63-331.91; p = 0.002), diabetes (odds ratio 20.16; 95% CI 5.55-73.18; p < 0.00001), cardiovascular disease (odds ratio 18.91; 95% CI 2.88-124.38; p = 0.002); and chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 12.34; 95% CI 9.90-15.39; p < 0.00001). Interestingly, lung disease added only a modest increase in risk (odds ratio 6.69; 95% CI 1.06-42.26; p < 0.00001).

ConclusionThe aforementioned comorbidities show surprisingly high risks of COVID-19 mortality when compared to the population with no comorbidity. Major comorbidities were enriched with pre-existing comorbidities that are common with increasing age (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension). The COVID-19 deaths were mostly associated with at least one comorbidity, which may be a source of the bias leading to the underestimation of the mortality risks previously reported. Taken together, this type of study is useful to approximate the risks, which most likely provide an updated awareness of age-related comorbidities.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThe phase 3 portion of this adaptive, randomized, master protocol, included 4,057 Covid-19 outpatients with one or more risk factors for severe disease. Patients were randomized to a single treatment of intravenous placebo, or various doses of REGEN-COV, and followed for 28 days. The prespecified hierarchical analysis first compared REGEN-COV 2400mg dose vs concurrent placebo, then compared the 1200mg dose vs concurrent placebo, for endpoints assessing risk of hospitalization or death, and time to symptom resolution. Safety was evaluated in all treated patients.

ResultsBoth REGEN-COV 2400mg and 1200mg significantly reduced Covid-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death compared to placebo (71.3% reduction [1.3% vs 4.6%; p<0.0001] and 70.4% reduction [1.0% vs 3.2%; p=0.0024], respectively). The median time to resolution of Covid-19 symptoms was 4 days shorter in both dose arms vs placebo (10 vs 14 days; p<0.0001). Efficacy of REGEN-COV was consistent across subgroups, including patients who were SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody-positive at baseline. REGEN-COV more rapidly reduced viral load than placebo.

As vaccines are gradually rolled out, attention has turned to when travel restrictions and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can be relaxed. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we develop a mathematical branching process model to assess the risk that, following the removal of NPIs, cases introduced into new locations initiate a local outbreak. Our model accounts for changes in background population immunity due to vaccination. We consider two locations in which the vaccine rollout has progressed quickly - specifically, the Isle of Man (a British crown dependency in the Irish Sea) and the country of Israel. We show that the outbreak risk is unlikely to be eliminated completely when travel restrictions and other NPIs are removed, even once the vaccine programmes in these locations are complete. Specifically, the risk that an imported case initiates an outbreak following the vaccine rollout and removal of NPIs is projected to be 0.373 (0.223,0.477) for the Isle of Man and 0.506 (0.387,0.588) for Israel. Key factors underlying these risks are the potential for transmission even following vaccination, incomplete vaccine uptake, and the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility. Combined, these factors suggest that when travel restrictions are relaxed, it will still be necessary to implement surveillance of incoming passengers to identify infected individuals quickly. This measure, as well as tracing and isolating contacts of detected infected passengers, should remain in place to suppress potential outbreaks until case numbers globally are reduced.",NA,medrxiv

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a pseudo-3D imaging modality that is widely used for AD diagnosis. Convolutional neural networks with 3D kernels (3D CNNs) are often the default choice for deep learning based MRI analysis. However, 3D CNNs are usually computationally costly and data-hungry. Such disadvantages post a barrier of using modern deep learning techniques in the medical imaging domain, in which the number of data can be used for training is usually limited. In this work, we propose three approaches that leverage 2D CNNs on 3D MRI data. We test the proposed methods on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset across two popular 2D CNN architectures. The evaluation results show that the proposed method improves the model performance on AD diagnosis by 8.33% accuracy or 10.11% auROC, while significantly reduce the training time by over 89%. We also discuss the potential causes for performance improvement and the limitation. We believe this work can serve as a strong baseline for future researchers.",NA,medrxiv

To rectify this, Governor Newsom ordered 4 million vaccine doses be reserved for the census tracts in the lowest quartile of the Healthy Places Index (HPI). California plans to lift state-wide restrictions on June 15th, 2021, as long as test positivity and vaccine equity thresholds are met in the states most vulnerable neighborhoods. This short investigation examines current vaccine equity and forecasts where California can expect to be when the economy fully reopens.

MethodsCurrent vaccine equity was investigated with simple linear regression between the county mean HPI and both single and full-dose vaccination rate. Future vaccination coverage per county were predicted using a compartmental mathematical model based on the average rate over the previous 30 days with four different rate-change scenarios.

ResultsCounty mean HPI had a strong positive association with both single and full dose vaccination rates (R2: 0.716 and 0.737, respectively). We predict the overall state rate will exceed 50% fully vaccinated by June 15th if the current rates are maintained; however, the bulk of this coverage comes from the top 18 counties while the remaining 40 counties lag behind.

DiscussionThe clear association between county HPI and current vaccination rates shows that California is not initiating opening plans from an equitable foundation, despite previous equity programs. If nothing changes, many of the most vulnerable counties will not be prepared to open without consequences come June 15th.",NA,medrxiv

Clinical settings are dynamic environments and the underlying data distributions characterising episodes can change with time (a phenomenon known as data drift), and so can the relationship between episode characteristics and associated clinical outcomes (so-called, concept drift). We demonstrate how explainable machine learning can be used to monitor data drift in a predictive model deployed within a hospital emergency department. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an exemplar cause of data drift, which has brought a severe change in operational circumstances. We present a machine learning classifier trained using (pre-COVID-19) data, to identify patients at high risk of admission to hospital during an emergency department attendance. We evaluate our models performance on attendances occurring pre-pandemic (AUROC 0.856 95%CI [0.852, 0.859]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (AUROC 0.826 95%CI [0.814, 0.837]). We demonstrate two benefits of explainable machine learning (SHAP) for models deployed in healthcare settings: (1) By tracking the variation in a features SHAP value relative to its global importance, a complimentary measure of data drift is found which highlights the need to retrain a predictive model.

To examine the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, for COVID-19 in Arkansas and Kentucky and investigate the impact of policies and preventative measures on the variability in Rt.

Methods

Arkansas and Kentucky county-level COVID-19 cumulative case count data (March 6-November 7, 2020) were obtained. Rt was estimated using the R package  EpiEstim, by county, region (Delta, non-Delta, Appalachian, non-Appalachian), and policy measures.

Results

The Rt was initially high, falling below 1 in May or June depending on the region, before stabilizing around 1 in the later months. The median Rt for Arkansas and Kentucky at the end of the study were 1.15 (95% credible interval [CrI], 1.13, 1.18) and 1.10 (95% CrI, 1.08, 1.12), respectively, and remained above 1 for the non-Appalachian region. Rt decreased when facial coverings were mandated, changing by -10.64% (95% CrI, -10.60%, -10.70%) in Arkansas and -5.93% (95% CrI, -4.31%, -7.65%) in Kentucky. The trends in Rt estimates were mostly associated with the implementation and relaxation of social distancing measures.

Conclusions

Arkansas and Kentucky maintained a median Rt above 1 during the entire study period. Changes in Rt estimates allows quantitative estimates of potential impact of policies such as facemask mandate.",NA,medrxiv

By the time, the second wave of Covid-19 impacted India, approximately 14 million healthcare and frontline workers, including dentists had been vaccinated.

AimTo study the effectiveness of vaccination on a subset of high-risk healthcare workers i.e. dentists in preventing Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic.

Study designA questionnaire based pan-India online survey was carried out to record the Covid-related experiences of dentists prior to and after vaccination.

ResultDuring the second wave, 9.18% (n=364) respondents became positive in spite of the vaccine, while 14.69%(n=78) became positive in the unvaccinated group. A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between vaccination and the Covid positivity rate in all age groups. The relation between these variables was highly significant, [X2 (1, N = 4493) = 15.9809, p=.000064].

MethodsThis was a retrospective study of patients who presented to the Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham, with suspected BK during 2015-2019. Relevant data, including the demographic factors, risk factors, clinical outcomes, and potential prognostic factors, were analysed.

ResultsA total of 283 patients (n=283 eyes) were included; mean age was 54.4{+/-}21.0 years and 50.9% were male. Of 283 cases, 128 (45.2%) cases were culture-positive. Relevant risk factors were identified in 96.5% patients, with ocular surface diseases (47.3%), contact lens wear (35.3%) and systemic immunosuppression (18.4%) being the most common factors. Contact lens wear was most commonly associated with P. aeruginosa whereas Staphylococci spp. were most commonly implicated in non-contact lens-related BK cases (p=0.017). At presentation, culture-positive cases were associated with older age, worse presenting corrected-distance-visual-acuity (CDVA), larger epithelial defect and infiltrate, central location and hypopyon (all p<0.01), when compared to culture-negative cases. Hospitalisation was required in 57.2% patients, with a mean length of stay of 8.0{+/-}8.3 days. Surgical intervention was required in 16.3% patients. Significant complications such as threatened/actual corneal perforation (8.8%), loss of perception of light vision (3.9%), and evisceration/enucleation (1.4%) were noted. Poor visual outcome (final corrected-distance-visual-acuity of <0.6 logMAR) and delayed corneal healing (>30 days from initial presentation) were significantly affected by age >50 years, infiltrate size >3mm, and reduced presenting vision (all p<0.05).

ConclusionBK represents a significant ocular morbidity in the UK. Culture positivity is associated with more severe disease at presentation but has no significant influence on the final outcome. Older age, large infiltrate, and poor presenting vision were predictive of poor visual outcome and delayed corneal healing, highlighting the importance of primary prevention and early intervention for BK.",NA,medrxiv

We describe the 12-month experience of the first UK dedicated Post-COVID clinical service to include both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients.

MethodsIn a single-centre, observational analysis, we report outcomes for 1325 individuals assessed in the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Post-COVID service between April 2020 and April 2021. Demography, symptoms, comorbidities, investigations, treatments, functional recovery, specialist referral and rehabilitation were compared by referral route (""post hospitalisation"", PH; ""non-hospitalised"", NH; and ""post emergency department"", PED). Symptoms associated with poor recovery or inability to return to work full-time were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.

Findings1325 individuals were assessed (PH 547 [41.3%], PED 212 [16%], NH 566 [42.7%]. Compared with PH and PED groups, NH were younger (median 44.6 [35.6-52.8] vs 58.3 [47.0-67.7] and 48.5 [39.4-55.7] years), more likely to be female (68.2%, 43.0% and 59.9%), less likely to be from an ethnic minority (30.9%, 52.7% and 41.0%) and seen later after symptom onset (median [IQR]:194 [118-298], 69 [51-111] and 76 [55-128] days) (all p<0.0001). NH patients had similar rates of onward specialist referral as PH and PED groups (18.7%, 16.1% and 18.9%, p=0.452), and were more likely to require support for breathlessness (23.7%, 5.5% and 15.1%, p<0.001) and fatigue (17.8%, 4.8%, 8.0%, p<0.001). Hospitalised patients had higher rates of pulmonary emboli, persistent lung interstitial abnormalities, and other organ impairment. 716 (54.0%) individuals reported <75% of optimal health (median [IQR] 70% [55%-85%]). Overall, less than half of employed individuals felt able to return to work full-time at first assessment.

InterpretationSymptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection were significant in both post- and non-hospitalised patients, with significant ongoing healthcare needs and utilisation. Trials of interventions and patient-centred pathways for diagnostic and treatment approaches are urgently required.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSPrevious evidenceC_ST_ABSLong COVID and post-COVID syndrome were first identified in April 2020. We searched PubMed and medrxiv for articles published up to April 30th, 2021, using the keywords ""long COVID"", ""post-COVID syndrome"", ""persistent symptoms"", ""hospitalised"", ""community"" and ""non-hospitalised"". We identified 17 articles and 7 systematic reviews. Fifteen studies have considered symptoms, multi-organ or functional impairment but only one study to-date has considered all these variables in non-hospitalised COVID patients. No studies have compared symptom burden and management between non-hospitalised and hospitalised individuals as systematically assessed and managed in a dedicated post-COVID service.

Added value of this studyFor the first time, we report the baseline characteristics, investigation and outcomes of initial assessment of all eligible patients in a dedicated multi-professional post-COVID service, including 547 post-hospitalisation, 566 non-hospitalised and 212 patients discharged from emergency department. Despite relatively low comorbidity and risk factor burden in non-hospitalised patients, we show that both non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients presenting with persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV2 infection have high rates of functional impairment, specialist referral and rehabilitation, even 6-12 months after the acute infection. These real-world data will inform models of care during and beyond the pandemic.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe significant, long-lasting health and social consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not confined to those who required hospitalisation. As with other long-term conditions, care of patients experiencing Long COVID or specific end-organ effects require consistent, integrated, patient-centred approaches to investigation and management. At public health and policy level, burden of post-COVID morbidity demands renewed focus on effective infection suppression for all age groups.",NA,medrxiv

ParticipantsIn the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), n = 10,109 participants aged 50-89 years were assessed at wave 1 (baseline: 2002-03) and followed-up over 16 years to wave 9 (2017-18).

MethodsVerbal memory was assessed biennially by tests of immediate and delayed word-recall. Positive and negative aspects of perceived relationship quality (social support and strain, respectively) were measured by relationship type (spouse; children; extended family members; friends). Random effects within-between (REWB) modelling was used to separate between- and within-person effects. Associations were estimated between levels of social support/strain and (i) baseline levels of memory (main effects), and (ii) the 2-year decline in memory (interaction with time).

ResultsLongitudinal associations were most prominent for men, specific to relationship type, and showed between-rather than within-person effects. Among men, higher spousal strain was associated with faster decline in memory ({beta}between-effectxtime = -0.043; 95% CI: -0.084, -0.002; p = 0.039), whilst greater support from children was associated with slower decline ({beta}between-effectxtime = 0.020; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.039; p = 0.033).

Thus, new guidelines, highly influenced by pathology, were devised for its diagnosis.

We attempted to study the impact of the 2020 HP guidelines on pathological diagnosis of previously diagnosed cases of IP. Cases with fibrotic IP diagnosed in 2014-2019 were classified according to the 2020 HP guidelines into three categories: typical HP, probable HP, and indeterminate HP. The original pathological diagnosis and categorization based on the HP guidelines were compared. The clinical data including the serum data and the pulmonary function tests were compared among the groups.The study analyzed 247 consecutive cases classified into typical, probable, and indeterminate for HP, and alternative diagnoses. The number of cases that changed from an original diagnosis other than HP to HP based on the guidelines was 56 (23%). The clinical data of these cases bore greater resemblance to cases diagnosed as indeterminate for HP than those cases diagnosed as typical or probable HP. The ratios of typical and probable HP to those of the total cases were significantly low using cryobiopsy.

Thus, with the application of the new guidelines, the pathological diagnosis of HP efficiently excluded HP cases but increased the rate of HP diagnosis for cases with fibrotic IP, which may not fit well to an HP diagnosis. Cryobiopsy may not be useful in imparting findings for fibrotic HP diagnosis using the new criteria.",NA,medrxiv

They are hypothesised to be a key mechanism that generates psychotic symptoms through the production of aberrant attribution of motivational salience and are proposed to result from accumulated childhood adversity and genetic risk, making the striatal system hyper-responsive to stress. However, few studies have examined whether children with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) also exhibit these alterations, limiting our understanding of how differences in reward processing relate to hallucinations and delusional ideation in childhood. Consequently, we examined whether PLEs and PLE-related distress were associated with reward-related activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The sample consisted of children (N = 6,718) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aged 9-10 years who had participated in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task in functional MRI. We used robust mixed-effects linear regression models to investigate the relationship between PLEs and NAcc activation during the reward anticipation and reward outcome stages of the MID task. Analyses were adjusted for gender, household income, ethnicity, depressive symptoms, movement in the scanner, pubertal development, scanner ID, subject and family ID.

In this study, we have developed a new approach based on 3D deep convolutional neural networks to accurately differentiate mild Alzheimers disease dementia from mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal individuals using structural MRIs. For comparison, we have built a reference model based on the volumes and thickness of previously reported brain regions that are known to be implicated in disease progression. We validate both models on an internal held-out cohort from The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on an external independent cohort from The National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC). The deep-learning model is more accurate and significantly faster than the volume/thickness model. The model can also be used to forecast progression: subjects with mild cognitive impairment misclassified as having mild Alzheimers disease dementia by the model were faster to progress to dementia over time. An analysis of the features learned by the proposed model shows that it relies on a wide range of regions associated with Alzheimers disease. These findings suggest that deep neural networks can automatically learn to identify imaging biomarkers that are predictive of Alzheimers disease, and leverage them to achieve accurate early detection of the disease.",NA,medrxiv

Methods and MaterialsClients with pathology-proven lesions (n=3,160) and age-matched controls (n=3,240) were selected from women screened at BreastScreen SA from January 2010 to December 2016 (n clients=207,691) and split into training, validation and test subsets (70%, 15%, 15% respectively). The primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC), in the SA Test Set 1 (SATS1), differentiating invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (n=469) from age-matched controls (n=490) and benign lesions (n=44). The NYU system was tested statically, after training without transfer learning (TL), after retraining with TL and without (NYU1) and with (NYU2) heatmaps.

ResultsThe static NYU1 model AUCs in the NYU test set (NYTS) and SATS1 were 83.0%(95%CI=82.4%-83.6%)(2) and 75.8%(95%CI=72.6%-78.8%), respectively. Static NYU2 AUCs in the NYTS and SATS1 were 88.6%(95%CI=88.3%-88.9%)(2) and 84.5%(95%CI=81.9%-86.8%), respectively. Training of NYU1 and NYU2 without TL achieved AUCs in the SATS1 of 65.8% (95%CI=62.2%-69.1%) and 85.9%(95%CI=83.5%-88.2%), respectively. Retraining of NYU1 and NYU2 with TL resulted in AUCs of 82.4%(95%CI=79.7-84.9%) and 86.3%(95%CI=84.0-88.5%) respectively.

ConclusionWe did not fully reproduce the reported performance of NYU on a local dataset; local retraining with TL approximated this level of performance. Optimising models for local clinical environments may improve performance. The generalisation of DL systems to new environments may be challenging.

Key ContributionsIn this study, the original performance of deep learning models for screening mammography was reduced in an independent clinical population.

Deep learning (DL) systems for mammography require local testing and may benefit from local retraining.

An openly available DL system approximates human performance in an independent dataset.

There are multiple potential sources of reduced deep learning system performance when deployed to a new dataset and population.",NA,medrxiv

Pulmonary factors including air trapping contribute to this limitation but the contribution of cardiovascular factors is unclear.

MethodsTo determine contribution of cardiovascular mechanisms to SHS-associated exercise limitation, we examined the cardiovascular responses to maximum effort exercise testing in 166 never-smokers with remote but prolonged occupational exposure to SHS and no known history of cardiovascular disease except nine with medically-controlled hypertension. We estimated the contribution of oxygen-pulse (proxy for cardiac stroke volume) and changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) and heart rate (HR) over workload towards exercise capacity, and examined whether the association of SHS with exercise capacity was mediated through these variables.

ResultsOxygen consumption (VO2Peak) and oxygen-pulse (O2-PulsePeak) at peak exercise were 1,516{+/-}431mL/min (100{+/-}23 %predicted) and 10.6{+/-}2.8mL/beat (117{+/-}25 %predicted), respectively, with 91 (55%) and 43 (26%) of subjects not being able to achieve their maximum predicted values. Sixty-two percent showed hypertensive response to exercise by at least one established criterion. In adjusted models, VO2Peak was associated directly with O2-Pulse and inversely with rise of SBP and DBP over workload (all P<0.05). Moreover, SHS exposure association with VO2Peak was mainly (84%) mediated through its effect on oxygen-pulse (P=0.034). Notably, although not statistically significant, a large proportion (60%) of air trapping effect on VO2Peak seemed to be mediated through oxygen-pulse (P=0.066).

MethodsPatients with a physician diagnosis of SpA within working age (18-65 years) were included. Associations between individual- (age, gender, education, marital status) and country-level factors (Human Development Index, Health Care Expenditure (HCE), Gross Domestic Product, percentage unemployed) with work outcomes (employment status, absenteeism, presenteeism) were assessed using multivariable mixed-effects models. Associations between individual factors and outcomes were compared according to SpA phenotypes and country-level factors using interaction terms.

ResultsA total of 3835 patients (mean age 42 years, 61% males) from 23 countries worldwide were included (66% axSpA, 10% pSpA, 23% PsA). Being employed was associated with gender (male vs. female OR 2.5; 95%CI 1.9-3.2), education (university vs. primary OR 3.7; 2.9-4.7), marital status (married vs. single OR 1.3; 1.04-1.6), and age in a non-linear manner. University (vs primary) education was associated with lower odds of absenteeism (OR 0.7; 0.5-0.96) and presenteeism (OR 0.5; 0.3-0.7). Associations were similar across SpA phenotypes. Higher HCE was associated with more favourable work outcomes, e.g., higher odds of employment (OR 2.5; 1.5-4.1). Gender discrepancy in odds of employment was greater in countries with lower socioeconomic development.

The current study sought to provide insight into the relationship between carbohydrate restriction and glycaemia by testing the effect of varying doses of carbohydrate on continuous glucose concentrations within a range of intakes defined as low-carbohydrate while controlling for confounding factors.

MethodsThis was a randomised crossover trial in participants with T2D testing 5 different 6-day eucaloric, isocaloric dietary treatments with varying carbohydrate contents (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% kcal). Diets were kept isocaloric by exchanging %kcal from carbohydrate with predominantly unsaturated fat, keeping protein constant at 15% kcal. Daily self-weighing was employed to ensure participants maintained their weight throughout each treatment arm. Between dietary treatments, participants underwent a washout period of at least 7 days and were advised to maintain their habitual diet. Glycemic control was assessed using a continuous glucose monitoring device that was placed while the participant was on their normal diet, and was worn for the 6 days of each treatment.

Results12 participants completed the study. There were no differences in 24-hour and postprandial sensor glucose concentrations between the 30%kcal and 10%kcal doses (7.4 {+/-} 1.1mmol/L vs 7.6 {+/-} 1.4mmol/L (P=0.28) and 8.0 {+/-} 1.4mmol/L vs 8.3 {+/-} 1.3mmol/L (P=0.28) respectively). In our exploratory analyses we did not find any dose-response relationship between carbohydrate intake and glycaemia. A small amount of weight loss occurred in each treatment arm (range: 0.4 to 1.1kg over the 6 days) but adjusting for these differences did not influence the primary or secondary outcomes.

ConclusionsModest changes in dietary carbohydrate content in the absence of weight loss while keeping dietary protein intake constant do not appear to influence glucose concentrations in people with T2D.

Study designHigh-speed photographic evaluation of aerosol and smoke generated in simulated surgical fields.

Materials and methodsSurgical site aerosol clearance was evaluated using a model of the anterior neck and prototypes for surgical site evacuator ports created using 3D printing. A commercially available electrocautery handpiece fitted with an evacuator was tested on animal tissue for smoke clearance. Both systems were connected to a commercial vacuum powered evacuation system. High speed photography was used to record videos of the aerosols and plumes. Fields were recorded with and without evacuation.

ResultsEfficient aerosol clearance from an open surgical field using an evacuator port is dependent upon the port design, airflow velocity, and placement relative to the aerosol generating site. The size and surface geometry of the surgical field are also important.

Surgical smoke generated with electrocautery is cleared from the field by the evacuation enclosure around the handpiece, even at high electrocautery power settings. Except for device noise, there appears to be no reason for using evacuator flow rates below the maximum setting.

ConclusionsBioaerosol and smoke generated during surgery are potential sources of respiratory pathogens and pose a threat to operating room personnel. Surgical site evacuation can significantly reduce the volume of airborne particles in the field but requires careful design and deployment considerations.x",NA,medrxiv

Materials and MethodsFifteen reviewers performed a manual chart review for 150 COVID-19 positive patients in the data mart. To support rapid chart review for a wide range of target data, we offered the Digital Analytic Patient Reviewer (DAPR). DAPR is a web-based chart review tool that integrates patient notes and provides note search functionalities and a patient-specific summary view linked with relevant notes. Within DAPR, we developed a COVID-19 validation task-oriented view and information extraction logic, enabled fast access to data, and considered privacy and security issues.

ResultsThe concepts for COVID-19 positive cohort, COVID-19 index date, COVID-19 related admission, and the admission date were shown to have high values in all evaluation metrics. For phenotypes, the overall specificities, PPVs, and NPVs were high. However, sensitivities were relatively low. Based on these results, we removed 3 phenotypes from our data mart. In the survey about using the tool, participants expressed positive attitudes towards using DAPR for chart review. They assessed the validation was easy and DAPR helped find relevant information. Some validation difficulties were also discussed.

Discussion and ConclusionDAPRs patient summary view accelerated the validation process. We are in the process of automating the workflow to use DAPR for chart reviews. Moreover, we will extend its use case to other domains.",NA,medrxiv

Study SettingAll encounters paid or provided by VA between January 1, 2019 and February 27, 2021.

Study DesignWe aggregated all VA paid or provided encounters and classified them into community (non-VA) acute and non-acute visits, VA acute and non-acute visits, and VA virtual visits. We then compared the number of encounters by week over time to pre-pandemic levels.

Data Extraction MethodsAggregation of administrative VA claims and health records.

Principal FindingsVA has experienced a dramatic and persistent shift to providing virtual care and purchasing care from non-VA providers. Before the pandemic, a majority (63%) of VA care was provided in-person at a VA facility. One year into the pandemic, in-person care at VAs constituted just 33% of all visits. Most of the difference made up by large expansions of virtual care; total VA provided visits (in person and virtual) declined (4.9 million to 4.2 million) while total visits of all types declined only 3.5%. Community provided visits exceeded prepandemic levels (2.3 million to 2.9 million, +26%).

ConclusionUnlike private health care, VA has resumed in-person care slowly at its own facilities, and more rapidly in purchased care with different financial incentives a likely driver. The very large expansion of virtual care nearly made up the difference. With a widespread physical presence across the U.S., this has important implications for access to care and future allocation of medical personnel, facilities, and resources.",NA,medrxiv

GX-19 contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and GX-19N contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) foldon and nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

MethodsTwo open-label phase 1 trials of GX-19 and GX-19N safety and immunogenicity were performed in healthy adults aged 19-55 years. GX-19 trial participants received two vaccine injections (1{middle dot}5 mg or 3{middle dot}0 mg, 1:1 ratio) four weeks apart. GX-19N trial participants received two 3{middle dot}0 mg vaccine injections four weeks apart.

FindingsBetween June 17 and July 30 and December 28 and 31, 2020, 40 and 21 participants were enrolled in the GX-19 and GX-19N trials, respectively. Thirty-two participants (52{middle dot}5%) reported 80 treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) after vaccination. All solicited AEs were mild except one case of moderate fatigue reported in the 1{middle dot}5 mg GX-19 group. Binding antibody responses increased after vaccination in all groups. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of spike-binding antibodies on day 57 were 85{middle dot}74, 144{middle dot}20, and 201{middle dot}59 in the 1{middle dot}5 mg, 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19 groups and the 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19N group, respectively. In GX-19N group, neutralizing antibody response (50% neutralizing titer using FRNT) significantly increased after vaccination, but GMT of neutralizing antibody on day 57 (37.26) was lower than those from human convalescent serum (288.78). GX-19N induced stronger T cell responses than GX-19. The magnitude of GX-19N-induced T cell responses was comparable to those observed in the convalescent PBMCs. GX-19N induced both SARS-CoV-2 spike- and NP-specific T cell responses, and the amino acid sequences of 15-mer peptides containing NP-specific T cell epitopes identified in GX-19N-vaccinated participants were identical with those of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants

InterpretationGX-19N is safe, tolerated and induces humoral and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response which may enable cross-reactivity to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo overcome the COVID-19 outbreak, the development of safe and effective vaccines is crucial. Despite the successful clinical efficacy of the approved vaccines, concerns exist regarding emerging new SARS-CoV-2 variants that have mutated receptor binding domains in the spike protein. We searched PubMed for research articles published up to May 1, 2021, using various combinations of the terms ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""vaccine"", and ""clinical trial"". No language or data restrictions were applied. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and World Health Organization (WHO) draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines for ongoing trials of COVID-19 vaccines up to May 1, 2021. Ten DNA-based vaccines, including the vaccine candidate reported here, are in ongoing clinical trials. Among these, safety and immunogenicity results were reported from only one phase 1 trial of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (INO-4800). INO-4800 demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability and was immunogenic, eliciting humoral and/or cellular immune responses in all vaccinated subjects. There is only one ongoing clinical trial of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants (mRNA-1273.351).

Added value of this studyThis is the first-in-human phase 1 trial in healthy adults of a recombinant DNA vaccine for COVID-19 (GX-19N) containing the coding regions of both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins. This trial showed that GX-19N is safe, tolerated, and able to induce both humoral and cellular responses. A two-dose vaccination of 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19N (on days 1 and 29) induced significant humoral and cellular responses. The neutralizing geometric mean titers in individuals vaccinated with GX-19N were lower than those of human convalescent sera. However, the GX-19N group showed increased T cell responses, which was similar to those analyzed using convalescent PBMCs. Furthermore, GX-19N induced not only SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell responses but also broad nucleocapsid-specific T cell responses, which were also specific to SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Implications of all the available evidenceIt is important to note that GX-19N contains a plasmid encoding both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, and that it showed broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, which may allow cross-reactivity with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on these safety and immunogenicity findings, GX-19N was selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsOur prospective multicentre cohort enrolled patient-facing HCWs from June to August 2020. Participants were asked about COVID-19 risk exposures/behaviours, including preferred mask type when caring for COVID-19 patients outside of aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). For those performing AGPs, we asked whether they used FFP2 irrespective of the patients COVID-19 status (i.e. universal use). The impact of FFP2 on i) self-reported SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal PCR/rapid antigen tests captured during weekly surveys, and ii) SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion between baseline and January/February 2021 was assessed.

ResultsWe enrolled 3259 participants from nine healthcare institutions, whereof 716 (22%) preferentially used FFP2 respirators. Among these, 81/716 (11%) reported a SARS-CoV-2-positive swab, compared to 352/2543 (14%) surgical mask users (median follow-up 242 days); seroconversion was documented in 85/656 (13%) FFP2 and 426/2255 (19%) surgical mask users. Adjusted for baseline characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and risk behaviour, FFP2 use was non-significantly associated with a decreased risk for SARS-CoV-2-positive swab (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0{middle dot}8, 95% CI 0{middle dot}6-1{middle dot}0, p=0{middle dot}052) and seroconversion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0{middle dot}7, 95% CI 0{middle dot}5-1{middle dot}0, p=0{middle dot}053); household exposure was the strongest risk factor (aHR for positive swab 10{middle dot}1, p<0{middle dot}001; aOR for seroconversion 5{middle dot}0, p<0{middle dot}001). In subgroup analysis, FFP2 use was clearly protective among those with frequent (>20 patients) COVID-19 exposure (aHR 0{middle dot}7, p<0{middle dot}001; aOR 0{middle dot}6, p=0{middle dot}035). Universal FFP2 use during AGPs showed no protective effect (aHR 1{middle dot}1, p=0{middle dot}7; aOR 0{middle dot}9, p=0{middle dot}53).

ConclusionRespirators compared to surgical masks may convey additional protection from SARS-CoV-2 for HCW with frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients.

MethodsCOVID-19 adult outpatients were enrolled within 7 days of symptom onset. Clinical symptoms were recorded via patient diary. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to quantitate SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and for infectious virus isolation in Vero E6-cells. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in serum using a validated ELISA assay.

ResultsAmong 204 participants with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID19, the median nasopharyngeal viral RNA was 6.5 (IQR 4.7-7.6 log10 copies/mL), and 26% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgM, IgG, and/or total Ig) at baseline. Infectious virus was recovered in 7% of participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to 58% of participants without antibodies (probability ratio (PR)=0.12, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.36; p=0.00016).

We implemented standardized, physiology-based, ICU admission criteria and analyzed the mortality rate of patients refused from the ICU.

Materials and MethodsCOVID-19 patients proposed for ICU admission were consecutively analyzed; Do-not-resuscitate patients were excluded. Patients presenting a SpO2 lower than 85% and/or dyspnea and/or mental confusion resulted eligible for ICU admission; patients not presenting these criteria remained in the ward with an intensive monitoring protocol. Primary outcome was both groups survival rate. Secondary outcome was a sub analysis correlating SpO2 cutoff with ICU admission.

ResultsFrom March 2020 to January 2021, 1623 patients were admitted to our Center; 208 DNR patients were excluded; 97 patients underwent intensivist evaluation. The ICU-admitted group mortality rate resulted 15.9% at 28 days and 27% at 40 days; the ICU-refused group mortality rate resulted 0% at both intervals (p < 0.001). With a SpO2 cut-off of 92%, the hypoxia rate distribution did not correlate with ICU admission (p = 0.26); with a SpO2 cut-off of 85%, a correlation was found (p = 0.009). A similar correlation was also found with dyspnea (p =0.0002).

ConclusionIn COVID-19 patients, standardized ICU admission criteria appeared to reduce safely ICU overload. In the absence of dyspnea and/or confusion, a SpO2 cutoff up to 85% for ICU admission was not burdened by negative outcomes. In a pandemic context, the SpO2 cutoff of 92%, as a threshold for ICU admission, needs critical re-evaluation.",NA,medrxiv

Screening programmes have attempted to reduce the mortality from BO associated oesophageal adenocarcinoma but cannot predict which BO patients will progress to invasive malignancy. We have previously identified the long non coding RNA, OR3A4, is differentially hypomethylated in progressive BO. We aimed to understand its role in BO pathogenicity

MethodsThe stable BO cell line CP-A, as well as the oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells line OE-33 was transfected with a lentiviral OR3A4 over-expression vector, and underwent high resolution microscopy, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, RNA sequencing, and targeted drug screening with the p38-MAPK inhibitor domipramod to understand the effects of OR3A4 expression on progression. We then compared progressive vs. non-progressive BO samples using quantitative multi-fluorophore (Vectra) immunohistochemistry.

ResultsOver-expression of OR3A4 in CP-A lines resulted in a hyperproliferative, dysplastic cellular phenotype, with strong over-expression of MAPK and anti-apoptotic pathways at the RNA and protein level, which was sensitive to the p38-MAPK inhibitor domipramod. Vectra immunohistochemistry demonstrated that progressive BO had reduced visibility associated with a reduction in CD8+ T-cells and CD68+ macrophages and reduced CD4+ T-cells in the stomal compartment.

ConclusionThe overexpression of OR3A4, which we have previously shown is associated with progressive BO leads to a proliferative dysplastic cellular phenotype associated with increased, reversible MAPK signalling and loss of immune visibility.",NA,medrxiv

Health systems are also limited in their ability to assess how well their palliative care services reach the population in need, which in turn makes it much more difficult to determine the quality, value, and effectiveness of those services. This study describes the creation, validation, and operationalization of an electronic registry of patients potentially eligible for palliative care at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, US.

ResultsThe electronic palliative care eligibility algorithm performed well within the chart review validation sample, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.903 and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.545. Within the 2.4 million individuals who contacted the SH electronic health record (EHR) during 2017, the final algorithm identified 1.1%-1.8% of patients (26,773-42,847) as potentially eligible for palliative care services. This included approximately 12.9%-17.7% of inpatients (16,392-22,507 out of 126,916), and 1.2%-1.9% of ambulatory care patients (20,140-32,212 out of 1.7 million).

ConclusionsA palliative care electronic patient registry was successfully created and operationalized. Performance based on an extensive chart review sample of Sutter Health patients indicated good capture of the palliative care-appropriate population, and this is further supported by successful identification of a majority of enrollees in Sutter Healths palliative care programs during 2017.",NA,medrxiv

However, our inability to accurately measure respiratory rate in hospitalised infants results in unreported episodes of apnoea and an incomplete picture of respiratory dynamics.

MethodsWe develop, validate and use a novel algorithm to identify inter-breath intervals (IBIs) and apnoeas in infants. In 42 infants (a total of 1600 hours of recordings) we assess IBIs from the chest electrical impedance pneumograph using an adaptive amplitude threshold for the detection of individual breaths. The algorithm is refined by comparing its accuracy with clinically-observed breaths and pauses in breathing. We also develop an automated classifier to differentiate periods of true central apnoea from artefactually low amplitude signal. We use this algorithm to explore its ability to identify morphine-induced respiratory depression in 15 infants. Finally, in 22 infants we use the algorithm to investigate whether retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening alters the IBI distribution.

Findings88% of the central apnoeas identified using our algorithm were missed in the clinical notes. As expected, morphine caused a shift in the IBI distribution towards longer IBIs, with significant differences in all IBI metrics assessed. Following ROP screening, there was a shift in the IBI distribution with a significant increase in the proportion of pauses in breathing that lasted more than 10 seconds (t-statistic=1.82, p=0.023). This was not reflected by changes in the monitor-derived respiratory rate or episodes of apnoea recorded on clinical charts.

InterpretationBetter measurement of infant respiratory dynamics is essential to improve care for hospitalised infants. Use of the novel IBI algorithm demonstrates that following ROP screening increased instability in respiratory dynamics can be detected in the absence of clinically-significant apnoeas.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSRespiratory disorders are one of the most common reasons for admission to a neonatal care unit and many pathologies and clinically-required procedures affect respiration. Despite this, current methods to measure respiratory rate in infants often provide inaccurate measurements due to factors such as poor electrode placement, movement artefact and cardiac interference. Lee and colleagues previously developed an algorithm to better identify episodes of apnoea in infants from the electrical impedance pneumograph following removal of cardiac-frequency interference. This algorithm substantially improves apnoea detection and demonstrates the high number of apnoeas that are missed in medical records. However, false apnoeas can be detected during periods of low amplitude signal caused by shallow breathing or poor electrode placement, and shorter inter-breath intervals (IBIs) cannot be assessed using the method proposed by Lee et al. limiting its use in assessing more subtle changes in an infants respiratory dynamics.

Added value of this studyWe develop, test and use a new algorithm for the identification of IBIs from the electrical impedance pneumograph. We use an adaptive amplitude threshold for the identification of breaths and develop a classification model to remove periods of low amplitude signal falsely identified as episodes of apnoea. Using the algorithm, we demonstrate that retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening causes a significant increase in pauses in breathing that last more than 10 seconds. Our apnoea detection method was more sensitive than the current standard monitor-derived approach that is used to monitor respiratory rate in neonatal care units.

Implications of all the available evidenceTo improve understanding of infant respiratory dynamics, better methods of assessment are essential. This will create a more complete clinical understanding of infant well-being, that will lead to improved treatment options for infants with respiratory disorders.",NA,medrxiv

Despite high fatality, the aetiology and pathophysiology of kwashiorkor remain enigmatic, including the role of serum albumin on oedema development. Here, we demonstrate that serum albumin is associated with the presence and severity of oedema among severely malnourished children. Further, in two independent cohorts of children in Malawi and Kenya, we show albumin-independent mechanisms are associated with oedema in SM, including oxidative stress and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Plasma concentrations of ECM-related proteins: lumican, podoplanin, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 were associated with kwashiorkor. We therefore conclude that the pathophysiology of kwashiorkor has both albumin-dependent and independent mechanisms. We discuss the ways in which albumin-independent mechanisms may explain the clinical features observed in kwashiorkor.",NA,medrxiv

Preadolescent suicidality is a major health problem with rising rates, yet its underlying biology is understudied. Here we studied effects of genetic stress susceptibility, estimated by polygenic risk score (PRS) for post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD), on preadolescent suicidality in participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R). We further evaluated PTSD-PRS effects on suicidality in the presence of environmental stressors that are established suicide risk factors. Analyses included both European and African ancestry participants using PRS calculated based on summary statistics from ancestry-specific genome-wide association studies. In European ancestry participants (N=4,619, n=378 suicidal), PTSD-PRS was associated with preadolescent suicidality (odds ratio [OR]=1.12, 95%CI 1-1.25, p=0.038). Results in African ancestry participants (N=1,334, n=130 suicidal) showed a similar direction but were not statistically significant (OR=1.21, 95%CI 0.93-1.57, p=0.153). Sensitivity analyses using non-psychiatric polygenic score for height and using cross-ancestry PTSD-PRS did not reveal any association with suicidality, supporting the specificity of the association of ancestry-specific PTSD-PRS with suicidality. Environmental stressors were robustly associated with suicidality across ancestries with moderate effect size for negative life events and family conflict (OR 1.27-1.6); and with large effect size (OR [~] 4) for sexual-orientation discrimination. When combined with environmental factors, PTSD-PRS showed marginal additive effects in explaining variability in suicidality, with no evidence for G X E interaction. Results support use of cross-phenotype PRS, specifically stress-susceptibility, as a robust genetic marker for suicidality risk early in the lifespan.",NA,medrxiv

We have extended recent work on neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) as a correlate of protection to account for protection against infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe disease using a joint estimation approach. We find that NAbs are strongly correlated with infection blocking and that natural infection provides stronger protection than vaccination for the same level of NAbs, though vaccines typically produce higher NAbs. We find only relatively weak correlations between NAbs and the probability of developing symptoms given a breakthrough infection, or the probability of severe disease given symptoms.

AKI was associated with longer hospitalization, greater admission and length of stay in the intensive care unit, a positive association with bacterial superinfection, sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, MV requirement and mortality (mortality with AKI=47.1% vs without AKI=12.4%, p<0.001). AKI was independently associated with higher mortality (aOR=3.32, 95%CI=1.6-6.9, p=0.001).

In conclusion, the incidence of AKI in adults hospitalized for COVID-19 was 19% and had a clear impact on morbidity and mortality. Local predisposing factors for AKI were identified.",NA,medrxiv

These include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis, infertility, and pregnancy-related disorders. However, the roles and mechanisms of obesity in the aetiology of reproductive disorders remain unclear.

Methods and FindingsWe estimated observational and genetically predicted causal associations between obesity, metabolic hormones, and female reproductive conditions using logistic regression, generalised additive models, and Mendelian randomisation (two-sample, non-linear, and multivariable) applied to data from UK Biobank and publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) were observationally (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.02 - 1.87 per 1 S.D. obesity trait) and causally (ORs = 1.06 - 2.09) associated with uterine fibroids (UF), PCOS, heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), and pre-eclampsia. Causal effect estimates of WHR and WHRadjBMI, but not BMI, were attenuated compared to their observational counterparts. Genetically predicted visceral adipose tissue mass was causal for the development of HMB, PCOS, and pre-eclampsia (ORs = 1.01 - 3.38). Increased waist circumference also posed a higher causal risk (ORs = 1.16 - 1.93) for the development of these disorders and UF than did increased hip circumference (ORs = 1.06 - 1.10). Leptin, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance each mediated between 20% -50% of the total causal effect of obesity on pre-eclampsia. Reproductive conditions clustered based on shared genetic components of their aetiological relationships with obesity.

ConclusionsIn this first systematic, large-scale, genetics-based analysis of the aetiological relationships between obesity and female reproductive conditions, we found that common indices of overall and central obesity increased risk of reproductive disorders to heterogenous extents, mediated by metabolic hormones. Our results suggest exploring the mechanisms mediating the causal effects of overweight and obesity on gynaecological health to identify targets for disease prevention and treatment.",NA,medrxiv

Receiving a score for most PSIs requires a minimum number of qualifying cases, which are partly determined by whether the associated diagnosis-related group (DRG) was surgical and whether the surgery was elective. While these criteria can exempt hospitals from PSIs, it remains to be seen whether exemption is driven by low volume, small numbers of DRGs, or perhaps, policies that determine how procedures are classified as elective.

MethodsUsing Medicare inpatient claims data from 4,069 hospitals between 2015 and 2017, we examined how percentages of elective procedures relate to numbers of surgical claims and surgical DRGs. We used a combination of quantile regression and machine learning based anomaly detection to characterize these relationships and identify outliers. We then used a set of machine learning algorithms to test whether outliers were explained by the DRGs they reported.

ResultsAverage percentages of elective procedures generally decreased from 100% to 60% in relation to the number of surgical claims and the number of DRGs among them. Some providers with high volumes of claims had anomalously low percentages of elective procedures (5% - 40%). These low elective outliers were not explained by the particular surgical DRGs among their claims. However, among hospitals exempted from PSIs, those with the greatest volume of claims were always low elective outliers.

ConclusionSome hospitals with relatively high numbers of surgical claims may have classified procedures as non-elective in a way that ultimately exempted them from certain PSIs.",NA,medrxiv

The assay demonstrated good inter- and intra-assay precision, accuracy, as well as excellent linearity across a range of over 6 orders of magnitude for target gene quantification. In addition, comparison of the assay on both dPCR and qPCR platforms revealed that dPCR exhibited a slightly higher sensitivity compared to its qPCR counterpart when quantifying SARS-CoV-2 at a lower concentration.

Self-reported solicited symptoms after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime were in line with previous reports and less severe after the BNT162b2 boost. Antibody titers increased significantly over time resulting in strong neutralization titers two weeks after the BNT162b2 boost. Neutralizing activity against the prevalent strain B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and immune-evading VOC B.1.351 (Beta) was [~]4-fold higher than in individuals receiving homologous BNT162b2 vaccination.

A set of simulation toolkits was utilized for the design and optimization of the self-resetting probe, allowing for highly consistent signal amplitudes across cyclic detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Idiosyncratically, FWHM regulated by dissipative kinetics exhibits a fingerprint signal for high confidential identification of single-nucleotide mutation in the virus sequence. We further exploited our self-resetting probes to examine multiple human-infectious RNA virus including SARS-CoV-2, ZIKV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV to demonstrate its generic nucleic acid detection capability and superior orthogonality. Self-resetting probes were also deployed for detection of 110 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and correctly classify all the clinical samples from 55 COVID-19 patients and 55 controls.

MethodsWe used publicly available large datasets to explore differences by country for Covid-19 mortality statistics. We continuously challenged our projections with reality and numbers from countries around the world, allowing us to refine our models and better understand the progression of the epidemic. All our predictions and findings were discussed and validated from a clinical viewpoint.

ResultsWhile no lockdown resulted in higher mortality, the difference between strict lockdown and lax lockdown was not terribly different and favored lax lockdown. Only one of the top 44 countries had long and strict restrictions. Strict restrictions were more common in the worst performing countries in terms of Covid mortality. The United States had both the largest economic growth coupled with the largest rate of mortality. Those who did well economically, had lower mortality and less pressure on their population. Yet they had less mortality than average and less than their neighbors.

ConclusionsCountries with the least restrictions fared best economically. Some of them fared well in terms of mortality, even better than neighboring countries with similar social structures and more severe restrictions. The mortality rates in the USA, however, appeared to suffer from very high obesity rates. Norway and the northern European countries have less strict restrictions from the rest of Europe and had lower mortality rates. COVID-19 mortality was associated with vitamin D status.",NA,medrxiv

Here, we evaluated a whole blood, multiplex host mRNA expression metric, Inflammatix-Severity-2 (IMX-SEV-2), for identifying septic, hospitalized patients for 30-day mortality, development of chronic critical illness (CCI), discharge disposition, and/or secondary infections.

MethodsThis is a retrospective, validation cohort analysis of a prospectively enrolled 335 patient study with surgical sepsis treated in the surgical intensive care unit. Whole blood collected in PAXgene(R) Blood RNA collection tubes at 24 hours post sepsis diagnosis was analyzed using a custom 29-mRNA classifier (IMX-SEV-2) in a CLIA-CAP-accredited diagnostic laboratory using the NanoString FLEX(R) profiler.

ResultsAmong patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria, the IMX-SEV-2 severity score was significantly better (p<0.05) at predicting secondary infections (AUROC 0.71) and adverse clinical outcomes (AUROC 0.75) than C-reactive protein (CRP), absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), total white blood cell (WBC) count, age and Charlson comorbidity index (and better, albeit nonsignificantly, than IL-6 and APACHE II). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, only combining the Charlson comorbidity index (AUROC 0.80) or APACHE II (AUROC 0.81) with the IMX-SEV-2 significantly improved prediction of adverse clinical outcomes, and combining with the Charlson comorbidity index for predicting 30-day mortality (AUROC 0.79).

ConclusionsThe IMX-SEV-2 severity score was superior at predicting secondary infections and overall adverse clinical outcomes versus other common metrics. Importantly, combining a rapidly measured transcriptomic metric with clinical or physiologic indices has sufficient precision to optimize resource utilization and allow adjustments to patient management that may improve outcomes in surgical sepsis. Hospitalized patients who are septic and present with an elevated IMX-SEV2 severity score and pre-existing comorbidities would be strong candidates for clinical interventions aimed at reducing the risk of secondary infections and adverse clinical outcomes.",NA,medrxiv

Although the scar prevents cardiac rupture, an excessive profibrotic response impairs optimal recovery.

ObjectiveTo explore the regulation of fibroblasts proliferation through a paracrine action of cardiac stromal cells post-MI

MethodsWe carried out a bioinformatic secretome analysis of cardiac stromal PW1+ cells isolated from normal and post-MI mouse hearts to identify novel secreted proteins. Functional assays were used to screen secreted proteins that promote fibroblast proliferation. The expressions of secreted proteins candidates were subsequently analyzed in mouse and human hearts and plasmas. The relation between levels of circulating protein candidates and adverse post-MI cardiac remodeling was examined in a cohort of 80 patients with a first ST-elevation MI and serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations.

ResultsCardiac stromal PW1+ cells undergo a change in paracrine behavior post-MI and secrete factors that promote fibroblast proliferation. Among these factors, growth differentiation factor 3 (GDF3), a member of the transforming growth factor-{beta} family, was markedly upregulated in the ischemic hearts and induced fibroblast proliferation at high level. In humans, GDF3 was detected in the plasma at day 4 post-MI and GDF3 circulating levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse remodeling 6-month post-MI (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.76 [1.03 - 3.00], p = 0.037).

However, in some parts of Indonesia, including East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP), this adherence is not achieved for a range of reasons including delays in visiting health centres. This study aims to determine factors related to the poor understanding of appropriate malaria treatment-seeking behaviour (AMTSB) of rural adults in ENTP. AMTSB was defined as seeking treatment at professional health facilities within 24 hours of the onset of malaria symptoms.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in the East Sumba, Belu, and East Manggarai district of ENTP between October and December 2019. A multi-stage cluster sampling procedure was applied to enrol 1495 participants aged between 18 and 89 years old. Data were collected through face-to-face interview. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess significant factors associated with the poor understanding of AMTSB.

Results86% of participants were found to be familiar with the term malaria. However, poor understanding level of AMTSB in rural adults of ENTP achieved 60.4% with a 95% confidence interval (CI): 56.9 - 63.8. The most important factors associated with the poor understanding were lower levels of education, low socio-economic status (SES), occupation, and distance to the nearest health facilities. The poor understanding of AMTSB was significantly higher for adults with no education (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.42, 95% CI: 1.81, 6.48); having low SES (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.96); residing three km away from the nearest health facilities (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.5); and working as housewife (AOR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.01 - 2.63). Ethnicity, and family size were not associated with the poor understanding of AMTSB.

ConclusionThe proportion of rural adults having a poor understanding of AMTSB was high leading to ineffective implementation of artemisinin-based combination therapies as the method to treat malaria in ENTP. Improving awareness of AMTSB for rural adults having low-level education, low SES, working as a housewife, and living three km from the nearest health facilities is critical to support the efficacy of malaria treatment in ENTP, as well as to advance the Indonesian governments objective to achieve malaria elimination by 2030.",NA,medrxiv

Although wastewaters can also be used for tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the population level, the reliability of this approach remains to be established, especially for early warning of outbreaks.

MethodsWe collected 377 samples from different treatment plants processing wastewaters of >1 million inhabitants in Valencia, Spain, between April 2020 and March 2021. Samples were cleaned, concentrated, and subjected to RT-qPCR to determine SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. These data were compared with cumulative disease notification rates over 7 and 14 day periods.

ResultsWe amplified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 75% of the RT-qPCRs, with an estimated detection limit of 100 viral genome copies per liter (gc/L). SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration correlated strongly with disease notification rates over 14-day periods (Pearson r = 0.962, P < 0.001). A concentration >1000 gc/L showed >95% sensitivity and specificity as an indicator of more than 25 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Albeit with slightly higher uncertainty, these figures were reproduced using a 7-day period. Time series were similar for wastewaters data and declared cases, but wastewater RNA concentrations exhibited transient peaks that were not observed in declared cases and preceded major outbreaks by several weeks.

InterpretationWastewater analysis provides a reliable tool for monitoring COVID-19, particularly at low incidence values, and is not biased by asymptomatic cases. Moreover, this approach might reveal previously unrecognized features of COVID-19 transmission.

We aimed to disentangle the unique contribution of racial/ethnic discrimination from other adversities associated with childhood suicidal ideation and attempts (suicidality) across races.

MethodWe analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R) that included a large, diverse sample of US children (N=11,235, mean age 10.9 years, 20.2% Black) phenotyped for environmental adversities including discrimination. Multivariate regression models tested the association of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination with suicidality, covarying for multiple confounders including other discrimination types (towards non-US born individuals; sexual orientation-based; weight-based). Matched analyses contrasted effects of racial/ethnic discrimination and racial identity on suicidality.

ResultsBlack youths reported more discrimination and higher suicidality rates than non-Black youths. High racial/ethnic discrimination was positively associated with suicidality, adjusting for other discrimination types (odds ratio [OR]=2.6, 95%CI=2.1-3.2). Findings remained significant after adjusting for multiple suicidality risk factors. Once experienced, racial/ethnic discrimination was similarly associated with suicidality in White, Black, and Hispanic youths. Matched analyses revealed that racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with suicidality (relative risk [RR]=2.7, 95%CI=2-3.5), while Black race was not (RR=0.9, 95%CI=0.7-1.2).

ConclusionRacial/ethnic discrimination is disproportionately experienced by Black children, and is associated with preadolescent suicidality, over and above other adversities. Findings highlight the need to address discrimination as part of suicide prevention strategies. Cross-sectional design hampers causal inferences.",NA,medrxiv

This study aims to investigate the possible association of PRSs for bipolar disorder, MDD, neuroticism, and schizophrenia (SCZ) with antidepressant non-response or non-remission in patients with MDD. PRSs were calculated at eight genome-wide P-thresholds based on publicly available summary statistics of the largest genome-wide association studies. Logistic regressions were performed between PRSs and non-response or non-remission in six European clinical samples, adjusting for age, sex, baseline symptom severity, recruitment sites, and population stratification. Results were meta-analysed across samples, including up to 3,637 individuals. Bonferroni correction was applied. In the meta-analysis, no result was significant after Bonferroni correction. The top result was found for MDD-PRS and non-remission (p=0.004), with patients in the highest vs. lowest PRS quintile being more likely not to achieve remission (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.11-1.98, p=0.007). Nominal associations were also found between MDD-PRS and non-response (p=0.013), as well as between SCZ-PRS and non-remission (p=0.035).

The current study summarizes findings from over 2,000 individuals with ASD who received genetic testing, including microarray and exome testing, through the Simons Simplex Consortium. A returnable genetic result is identified in 10% of cases, however, this yield increases based on four readily accessible phenotypes: female sex and the presence of intellectual disability, seizures or delayed walking. Combinations of these factors increase return rate further, with some combinations yielding a return rate over 50%. In conclusion, these four phenotypes provide a simple approach to prioritize genetic testing in a clinical setting and inform future clinical guidelines.

MethodsThe patient cohort was composed of 159 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients aged 42.17 {+/-} 10.25 years and disease duration of 10.74 {+/-} 7.51 years. The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were used to assess clinical disability. Cortical thickness and thalamic volume were evaluated as imaging measures of neurodegeneration.

ResultsA total of 4,469 multiple sclerosis lesions were identified, of which 171 QSM rim+ (3.8%) lesions were identified among 57 patients (35.9%). In a multivariate regression model, as the overall total lesion burden increased, patients with at least one rim+ lesion on QSM performed worse on both physical disability and cognitive assessments, specifically the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p=0.010), California Verbal Learning Test-II (p=0.030), and EDSS (p=0.001). In a separate univariate regression model, controlling for age (p<0.001), having at least one rim+ lesion was related to more cortical thinning (p= 0.03) in younger patients (< 45 years). Lower thalamic volume was associated with older patients (p=0.038) and larger total lesion burden (p<0.001) however, the association did not remain significant with rim+ lesions (p=0.10).

MethodsA retrospective single-center study examining womens IVF treatment parameters and pregnancies before and after their vaccination between February and May 2021. Each woman served as a self-control before and after vaccination. Additionally, in order to neutralize the effect of the sperm on fertilization, only Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) patients who were currently being treated with an ICSI cycle and had an earlier ICSI cycle available were included in the study. The study outcomes compared between the PRE and POST vaccination groups and consisted of: the IVF cycle outcomes, including the number of oocytes retrieved; the number of matured oocytes; the fertilization rate; and the number and quality of embryos at day 3. Clinical pregnancy was based on the first hCG value reported if the data were available for both cycles.

ResultsA final total of 47 women were eligible for inclusion with a mean interval of 362 {+/-}368 days between the two ovum pick ups. The characteristics of their ICSI cycles before and after the vaccination were similar for all the parameters. Additionally, the number and percentage of clinical pregnancies did not significantly differ between the PRE and POST vaccination groups (n=15).

Admission to an alternative care setting may lower the incidence of delirium. The Acute Geriatric Community Hospital (AGCH) was recently opened in the Netherlands and uses a multi-component non-pharmacological intervention strategy to prevent delirium.

ObjectiveTo describe the incidence of delirium found in the AGCH and compare this incidence to a hospital control group found in literature.

DesignProspective cohort study; exploratory meta-analysis of proportions.

SettingThe AGCH is an acute geriatric unit in an intermediate care facility.

ParticipantsPatients aged >65 years with acute medical conditions admitted to the AGCH.

MethodsDelirium assessment using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) upon admission and on day one, two and three or until delirium had resolved. Patients charts were reviewed if CAM was missing. In an logistic mixed-effects model, the delirium incidence rate in AGCH was compared to pooled delirium incidence rates from six studies found in a high-quality review.

Results214 patients from the AGCH (mean age 81.9 years, 47% male, 12% with a history of dementia) were included in the analysis. Delirium developed in 8% (18/214) (95% CI [confidence interval] 5-13%) of patients during AGCH admission compared to 16% (95% CI 12-21%) in hospitals.

The elimination status defined by the World Health Organization aims to identify countries where the virus is no longer circulating and can be verified after 36 months of interrupted transmission. However, since 2018, numerous countries have lost their elimination status soon after reaching it, showing that the indicators used to define elimination may not be predictive of lower risks of outbreaks.

Methods and FindingsWe quantified the impact of local vaccine coverage and recent levels of incidence on the dynamics of measles in each French department between 2009 and 2018, using mathematical models based on the  Epidemic-Endemic regression framework. High values of local vaccine coverage were associated with fewer imported cases and lower risks of local transmissions. Regions that had recently reported high levels of incidence were also at a lower risk of local transmission, potentially due to additional immunity accumulated during these recent outbreaks. Therefore, all else being equal, the risk of local transmission was not lower in areas fulfilling the elimination criteria (i.e., low recent incidence). After fitting the models using daily case counts, we used the parameters estimates to simulate the effect of variations in the vaccine coverage and recent incidence on future transmission. A decrease of 3% in the three-year average vaccine uptake led to a five-fold increase in the number of cases simulated in a year on average.

ConclusionsSpatiotemporal variation in vaccine coverage because of disruption of routine immunisation programmes, or lower trust in vaccines, can lead to large increases in both local and cross regional transmission. The association found between local vaccine coverage and incidence suggests that, although regional vaccine uptake can be hard to collect and unreliable because of population movements, it can provide insights into the risks of imminent outbreak. Periods of low local measles incidence were not indicative of a decrease in the risks of local transmission. Therefore, the incidence indicator used to define the elimination status was not consistently associated with lower risks of measles outbreak in France. More detailed models of local immunity levels or subnational seroprevalence studies may yield better estimates of local risk of measles outbreaks.",NA,medrxiv

The main objective of this study is to investigate distributional shifts underlying observed age and cohort differences in mean levels of psychological distress in the 1958 and 1970 British birth cohorts. Further, we examine whether observed distributional shifts are driven by specific socio-demographic subgroups, according to gender, parental social class at birth, and highest achieved qualification by age 30/33. Finally, we compare cohort and age differences in the distribution of individual symptoms of psychological distress.

MethodsThis study used data from the 1958 National Child Development Study and 1970 British birth cohort. Our analytical sample (n=24,707) included those who had at least one measure of distress, were still alive and were not permanent emigrants from Britain by age 50 in the 1958 birth cohort (n=13,250) and by age 46-48 in the 1970 birth cohort (n=11,457). Psychological distress was measured by the Malaise Inventory at ages 23, 33, 42 and 50 in the 1958 cohort and 26, 34, 42 and 46-48 in the 1970 cohort.

ResultsThe shifts in the distribution across age appear to be mainly due to changing proportion of those with moderate symptoms, except for midlife (age 42-50) when we observed polarisation in distress - increased proportions of people with no or multiple symptoms. The elevated levels of distress in the 1970 cohort, compared with the 1958 cohort, appeared to be due to an increase in the proportion of individuals with both moderate and high symptoms. For instance, at age 33/34 34.2% experienced no symptoms in 1970 compared with 54.0% in the 1958 cohort, whereas 42.3% endorsed at least two symptoms in the 1970 cohort vs 24.7% in 1958. These observed shifts were driven to some extent by a larger proportion of men and individuals with high qualification in the moderate and high distress groups in the more recent cohort. Fatigue, nervousness, and tension were particularly prevalent in this life phase and all examined symptoms were more prevalent in the younger cohort.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the importance of studying not only mean levels of distress over time, but also the underlying shifts in its distribution. Due to the large dispersion of distress scores at any given measurement occasion, understanding the underlying distribution provides a more complete picture of population trends.",NA,medrxiv

It subsequently spread to other countries in the region. The objective of this study is to analyze the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 in West Africa from the first reported case to 31 January 2021.

MethodWe publicly used available data from reliable sources and from the ""COVID-19R"" package. We used epidemic curves to describe the trends in the daily evolution of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in West Africa and specifically in the five countries. The reproduction rate and evolution rates were calculated from these trends.

ResultsAs of 31 January 2021, West Africa had 342,938 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 4,496 deaths. Nigeria had 131,242 cases with 1,586 deaths. Senegal had 26,523 cases with 628 deaths. The case-fatality rate in Mali was 4.08% and the attack rate in Cape Verde was 2587 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania and Mali, the epidemic curves supported by the evolution rates showed an increase in confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 during December 2020 and January 2021 compared to the last two months. The effective reproduction rates (Re) inferred a slowdown in virus transmission (Re < 1) in these countries except for Senegal.

ConclusionThe results showed that COVID-19 was still circulating in some West African countries in late 2020 and early 2021. By improving the health system and with context-specific public health interventions and vaccination, these countries should effectively control COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

J.; Reicher, S. D.",Alex de Figueiredo,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,2021-06-01,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,cc_by_nd,health policy,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/01/2021.05.31.21258122.source.xml,"BackgroundFour vaccines against the novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have currently been approved for use in the United Kingdom. As of 30 April 2021, over 34 million adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The UK Government is considering the introduction of vaccine passports for domestic use and to facilitate international travel for UK residents. Although vaccine incentivisation has been cited as a motivating factor for vaccine passports, it is currently unclear whether vaccine passports are likely to increase inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine.

MethodsWe conducted a large-scale national survey in the UK of 17,611 adults between 9 and 27 April 2021. Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification is used to provide unbiased national-level estimates of the impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines among all respondents who have not yet had two vaccination doses. Multilevel regressions identify the differential impact of the likely impact of vaccine passports on uptake intent between socio-demographic groups. Gibbs sampling was used for Bayesian model inference, with 95% highest posterior density intervals used to capture uncertainty in all parameter estimates.

FindingsWe find that the introduction of vaccine passports will likely lower inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once baseline vaccination intent has been adjusted for. Notably, this decrease is larger if passports were required for domestic use rather than for facilitating international travel. The impact of passports while controlling for baseline vaccination intent differentially impacts individuals by socio-demographic status, with being male (OR 0{middle dot}87, 0{middle dot}76 to 0{middle dot}99) and having degree qualifications (OR 0{middle dot}84, 0{middle dot}72 to 0{middle dot}94) associated with a decreased inclination to vaccinate if passports were required for domestic use, while Christians (OR 1{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}08 to 1{middle dot}41) have an increased inclination over atheists or agnostics. There is a strong association between change in vaccination inclination if passports were introduced and baseline vaccination intent: stated change in vaccination inclination is thus lower among Black or Black British respondents (compared to Whites), younger age groups, and non-English speakers. We find notable sub-national trends, for example, that passports could increase inclination among students and Jewish respondents in London compared to those in full-time education or atheists or agnostics, respectively.

InterpretationTo our knowledge, this is the first quantitative assessment of the potential impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on COVID-19 vaccine intention. Our findings should be interpreted in light of sub-national trends in current uptake rates across the UK, as our results suggest that vaccine passports may induce a lower vaccination inclination in socio-demographic groups that cluster geographically in large urban areas. Caution should therefore be exercised in introducing passports as they may result in less positive health-seeking behaviours for the COVID-19 vaccine (as well as other existing or future vaccinations) and may contribute to concentrated areas of low vaccinate uptake, which is an epidemic risk. We call for further evidence on the impact of vaccine certification on confidence in COVID-19 vaccines and in routine immunisations in wider global settings and, in particular, in countries with low overall trust in vaccinations or in authorities that administer or recommend vaccines.

FundingThis survey was funded by the Merck Investigator Studies Program (MISP)

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSProof of vaccination has, to date, had limited use in public and private settings for the UK public, such as proof of yellow fever vaccination for international travel to limited destinations, or requirements of Hepatitis B vaccination in some medical roles. Although recent surveys have suggested that the majority of the British public support vaccine passports, we are not aware of any studies assessing the impact that proof of vaccination status for domestic use or for international travel may have on vaccination inclination and thus--perhaps more importantly--on epidemic spread.

Added value of this studyWe conducted a large-scale survey of more than 17,000 members of the UK public to explore attitudes to vaccine passports for domestic and international use. Bayesian methods are used to compute nationally representative estimates of the impact of vaccine passports on change in inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines and to establish the socio-demographic determinants of vaccination inclination. This study is, as far as we are aware, the first to assess the impact of vaccine passports on vaccination inclination in the UK.

Implications of all the possible evidenceThis study provides novel insights into the potential impact of vaccine passports on COVID-19 vaccine intent in the UK. Although we find that vaccine passports receive popular support in the UK, there exists large variations in their appeal that stratify along socio-demographic lines. Most notably, younger age groups, Black and Black British ethnicities (compared to Whites), and non-English speakers are more likely to express a lower inclination to vaccinate if passports were introduced. Although these groups comprise a relatively small proportion of the UK population, there are crucial issues that these perceptions among these groups cause: notably, that these groups tend to have lower baseline vaccination intent and they cluster geographically. Therefore, since geographic clusters of low vaccination uptake can result in disproportionate increases in required vaccination levels for herd immunity in adjacent settings, we need to exercise extreme caution in public health interventions that may push these areas further away from vaccination. This is especially so if such an intervention will have little overall impact on the majority of the population outside these areas who are already quite willing to vaccinate. Overall, we find that the introduction of passports for either domestic or international use has a net negative impact on vaccination inclination, once we control for baseline vaccination intent. Our findings suggest that vaccination passports may not only yield damaging health outcomes for already marginalised communities: this may lead to further distrust in the government and public health systems and may have negative downstream consequences for other health-seeking behaviours, for example, routine immunisations.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed to explore the feasibility of these hybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds for PICU patients from the HCWs perspective.

MethodsA mixed quantitative and qualitative deductive thematic content analysis of narrative responses from pediatric intensive care HCWs were analyzed, descriptive statistics were used

ResultsA total of 31 HCW were included in the analysis; the mean time of the virtual round was 72.45 minutes vs. 34.68 for physical rounds, the most shared component in the virtual round was CXR (93.5%). Some of the HCWs perceived advantages of the hybrid rounds were enabling the multidisciplinary discussions, lesser round interruptions, and practicality of the virtual discussions. The perceived challenges were the difficulty of the bedside nurse to attend the virtual round, decreased teaching opportunities for the trainees, and decreased interactions among the team members, especially if the video streaming was not utilized.

ConclusionHybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds in PICU were perceived as feasible by HCWs. The virtual rounds decreased the physical contact between the HCWs, which could decrease the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spread among the treating team. Still, several components of the hybrid round could be optimized to facilitate the virtual team-members interactions and enhance the teaching experience.",NA,medrxiv

The country plans to roll-out the three-month short-course TPT regimen (3HP) to address the implementation lag and poor uptake of the 6-9-month regimens. The study measured the level of organizational readiness while identifying barriers and facilitators to implement 3HP in four health facilities in Zimbabwe.

MethodsA convergent, parallel mixed-methods approach was used to collect data from four primary healthcare clinics in Bulawayo and Harare Metropolitan provinces, Zimbabwe. Twenty healthcare providers completed a 35-item, self-administered questionnaire designed on a 5-point Likert scale and developed from the Weiner organizational readiness model. Nine of the providers and five TB program managers took part in 20-30 minute individual semi-structured key-informant interviews. Median scores with interquartile ranges were calculated wherein a score of 3.3 or greater indicated readiness. Differences between facilities were assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis rank test. Qualitative data on barriers and facilitators were transcribed and analyzed using a framework approach.

ResultsReadiness to implement 3HP across the four facilities was positive with a score of 3.8(IQR 3.3-4.1). The difference between the best 4.0(IQR 3.8-4.2) and worst-performing facility 3.2(IQR 2.7-3.3) was 0.8 and statistically significant (p=0.039). The low facility score was due to poor contextual factors 2.5(IQR 2.0-3.3), task demands 2.6(IQR 2.3-2.9), and resource availability 2.1(IQR 1.5-2.5) scores. Key organizational readiness facilitators included healthcare provider and management buy-in; community willingness to generate demand for 3HP; strong collective capability through task-shifting, alignment with existing primary healthcare programs, perceived benefits, and need for 3HP. Barriers were negative past TPT experiences, suboptimal programmatic monitoring, inconsistent health provider remuneration, inadequate staffing, added workload, and an erratic supply chain across facilities. The organizational communication gap prompts the slow program implementation culture.

ConclusionsThe varied scores between facilities suggest distinct underlying conditions for readiness. Healthcare provider motivation is temporary based on the inconsistent resource supply, absence of TPT-specific monitoring and evaluation, and daily contextual challenges in facilities that must be addressed. Similar research is necessary for countries yet to implement 3HP to optimize the design or revision of delivery strategies and increase uptake of TPT.",NA,medrxiv

This paper reports on FASD prevalence in a small sample.

MethodsA two-phase active case ascertainment study was conducted in three mainstream primary schools in Greater Manchester, UK. Schools were located in areas that ranged from relatively deprived to relatively affluent. Initial screening of children aged 8-9 years used pre-specified criteria for elevated FASD risk (small for age; special educational needs; currently/previously in care; significant social/emotional/mental health symptoms). Screen positive children were invited for detailed ascertainment of FASD using gold standard measures.

ResultsOf 220 eligible children, 50 (23%) screened positive and 12% (26/220) proceeded to phase-two assessment. Twenty had a developmental disorder, four had FASD and four were assessed as possible FASD. The crude prevalence rate of FASD in these schools was 1.8% (95%CI: 1.0%,3.4%) and when including possible cases was 3.6% (2.1%,6.3%). None of these children had previously identified with a developmental diagnosis.

This study explored one of the main issues that determine whether people engage with NHSTT, how people understand symptoms that may indicate the presence of COVID-19 and that should trigger a request for a test.

MethodsIn this qualitative study, a series of semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 40 people (21 members of the general population, 19 students). There was nearly an equal split between male and female participants in both populations. Data were collected between 30 November and 11 December 2020 and explored using thematic analysis. There was substantial similarity in responses for both populations so we combined our results and highlighted where differences were present.

ResultsParticipants generally had good knowledge of the main symptoms of COVID-19 (high temperature, new, persistent cough, anosmia) but had low confidence in their ability to differentiate them from symptoms of other illnesses. Attribution of symptoms to COVID-19 was most likely where the symptoms were severe, many symptoms were present, symptoms had lasted for some time and when perceived risk of exposure to infection was high due to previous contact with others. Participants felt encouraged to engage in testing where symptoms were present and had persisted for several days, though many had concerns about the safety of testing centres and the accuracy of test results. Students had mixed feelings about mass asymptomatic testing, seeing it as a way to access a more normal student experience, but also a potential waste of resources.

ConclusionsThis study offers novel insights into how people attribute symptoms to COVID-19 and barriers and facilitators to engaging with testing. Participants had positive views of testing, but there is a need to improve not just recognition of each main symptom, but also understanding that even single, mild symptoms may necessitate a test rather than a ""wait and see"" approach, and to address concerns around test accuracy to increase testing uptake.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThe 14-day incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases per NACE-BEL code is described in the periods immediately preceding the Belgian more strict measures of October 19, 2020, and is evaluated longitudinally by a Gaussian-Gaussian modelling two-stage approach. Additionally, the number of high-risk contacts in working segments and regions is described.

ResultsThe peak of COVID-19 14-day incidence in most NACE-BEL sectors is reached in the period October 20-November 2, 2020 and was considerably higher than average in human health activities, residential care activities, fitness facilities, human resource provision, hairdressing and other beauty treatment and some public service activities. Human health activities, residential care activities, food and beverage service activities, hotels, arts, food retail activities, and human resources provision have high pre-lockdown incidences. The frequency of index cases that report more than two high risk contacts is increasing over time in all sectors.

ConclusionDespite the restrictive protocols present in many sectors before the Autumn wave, employees in activities where close contact with others is high, show increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Especially sports activities are among the highest risk activities. Finally, the increasing amount of high-risk contacts by COVID-19 confirmed cases is compatible with the decreasing motivation over time to adhere to the measures.

Key Messages

What is already known about this subject?Certain occupational sectors, such as human health and care, food and beverage, cultural and sport activities, have been related to a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the workplace.

What are the new findings?COVID-19 confirmed cases of employees are linked with the main economic activity of their employer. The effect of opening of sectors, potentially under restrictive protocols, is evaluated. Despite the restrictive protocols present in many sectors, employees in activities where close and/or prolonged contact with others is high exhibit increased risk of COVID-19 infection, even higher than the high-risk sector of human health and care. Full restriction of these sectors decreases adequately the COVID-19 incidences, even in those sectors with physical contacts that remain open, for example human health, care and food shops. Finally, the increasing amount of high-risk contacts by COVID-19 confirmed cases might be related to decreasing motivation over time to adhere to the measures.

How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?These insights offer guidance to policy makers on which economic activity to restrict or subject to stricter protocols to better control the COVID-19 pandemic whilst keeping the work floor as safe as possible.",NA,medrxiv

Early detection is vital to provide the best treatment possible and liquid biopsies combined with analysis of circulating tumour DNA methylation show great promise as a non-invasive approach for early cancer diagnosis and monitoring with low false negative rates.

MethodsTo identify reliable diagnostic biomarkers of early HCC, we performed a systematic analysis of multiple hepatocellular studies and datasets comprising >1,500 genome-wide DNA methylation arrays, to define a methylation signature predictive of HCC in both tissue and cell-free DNA liquid biopsy samples.

ResultsOur machine learning pipeline identified differentially methylated regions in HCC, some associated with transcriptional repression of genes related with cancer progression, that benchmarked positively against independent methylation signatures. Combining our signature of 38 DNA methylation regions, we derived a HCC detection score which confirmed the utility of our approach by identifying in an independent dataset 96% of HCC tissue samples with a precision of 98%, and most importantly successfully separated cfDNA of tumour samples from healthy controls. Notably, our risk score could identify cell-free DNA samples from patients with other tumours, including colorectal cancer.

ConclusionsTaken together, we propose a comprehensive HCC DNA methylation fingerprint and an associated risk score for the early diagnosis and early relapse detection of HCC from liquid biopsies.",NA,medrxiv

During the second wave, a series of control measure were progressively introduced that initially slowed the growth of the epidemic then resulted in decreasing cases until there was no detectable local transmission.

MethodsTo determine the relative efficacy of the progressively introduced intervention measures, we modelled the second wave as a series of exponential growth and decay curves. We used a linear regression of the log of daily cases vs time, using a four-segment linear spline model corresponding to implementation of the three successive major public health measures. The primary model used all reported cases between 14 June and 15 September then compared the projection of the model with observed cases predict future case trajectory up until the 31 October to assess the use of exponential models in projecting the future course and planning future interventions. The main outcome measures were the exponential daily growth constants, analysis of residuals and estimates of the 95% confidence intervals for the expected case distributions, comparison of predicted daily cases.

ResultsThe exponential growth/decay constants in the primary analysis were: 0.122 (s.e. 0.004), 0.035 (s.e. 0.005), -0.037 (s.e. 0.011), and -0.069 (s.e. 0.003) for the initial growth rate, Stage 3, stage 3 + compulsory masks and Stage 4, respectively. Extrapolation of the regression model from the 14 September to the 31 October matched the decline in observed cases over this period.

ObjectiveTo identify factors associated with the presence of cytopathological changes of the cervix, HIV and/or syphilis in women who performed the Pap Smear (PS) at Family Health Unit (FHU) San Martin, in Salvador-BA, 09 March 2015 to 2018.

Materials and methodsThis cross-sectional study consisted of 150 participants. After application of a questionnaire, there was conducted clinical examination of the breast and gynecological and rapid tests for diagnosis of syphilis and HIV types 1 and 2. The bivariate analysis was made by associating each one of the independent variables with the outcome, through contingency tables (Chi-square test and when necessary, the Fishers exact test). The estimates were obtained with Prevalence Ratio (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) and p values. Mean differences were estimated through Students t-test. The goodness of the test was estimated by ratio of maximum likelihood (p [&le;] 0.05).

ResultsThere were 11.33% of women with injury and 88.67% without injury. The group with injury (n = 17) presented the worst values in relation to the use of the cigarette (17.65% vs 3.76%) and clinical examination in breast change issues (17.65% vs 4.51%) and unloading (11.76% vs papillary 1.50%), in comparison to the group without precursor lesion pro CC, statistically significant (p [&le;] 0.05). 5 cases were positive for syphilis (3.33%), and no case of HIV types 1 and 2.

DiscussionThe study confirmed risk factors for injury precursors of CC, such as smoking and mammary changes, as well as how much research related to diverged condom use and reducing the risk of injury and the likely Association with Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI).

ConclusionThere was detected a low percentage of women with precursor lesions for the CC (11.33%), that were not associated with syphilis and HIV types 1 and 2, but were correlated the expected factors like mammary changes and smoking. The reorganization of actions of active search of women with risk factors for CC for the EP can culminate in the reduction of this cancer.

Participating in arts groups was associated with higher positive affect (average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)=0.19, 95% CI=0.13-0.24), life satisfaction (ATT=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.16), purpose in life (ATT=0.08, 95% CI=0.02-0.14), and mastery (ATT=0.08, 95% CI=0.02-0.13) than not participating. Arts group participation was not associated with negative affect or constraints on personal control. After matching on a range of potential confounders, participation in arts groups was associated with the positive elements of evaluative, experienced, and eudaimonic wellbeing. Facilitating participation in community arts groups could help to promote healthy aging, enabling a growing segment of the population to lead more fulfilling and satisfying lives.",NA,medrxiv

Translating these genetic findings into druggable genes and readily available compounds that reduce COVID-19 host susceptibility is a critical next step.

MethodsWe integrate COVID-19 genetic susceptibility variants, multi-tissue genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) and perturbargen signatures to identify candidate genes and compounds that reverse the predicted gene expression dysregulation associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. The top candidate gene is validated by testing both its GReX and observed blood transcriptome association with COVID-19 severity, as well as by in vitro perturbation to quantify effects on viral load and molecular pathway dysregulation. We validate the in silico drug repositioning analysis by examining whether the top candidate compounds decrease COVID-19 incidence based on epidemiological evidence.

ResultsWe identify IL10RB as the top key regulator of COVID-19 host susceptibility. Predicted GReX up-regulation of IL10RB and higher IL10RB expression in COVID-19 patient blood is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. In vitro IL10RB overexpression is associated with increased viral load and activation of immune-related molecular pathways. Azathioprine and retinol are prioritized as candidate compounds to reduce the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19.

ConclusionsWe establish an integrative data-driven approach for gene target prioritization. We identify and validate IL10RB as a suitable molecular target for modulation of COVID-19 host susceptibility. Finally, we provide evidence for a few readily available medications that would warrant further investigation as drug repositioning candidates.",NA,medrxiv

Varshney,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,2021-06-02,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,cc_by_nc_nd,health economics,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/02/2021.05.26.21257598.source.xml,"BackgroundSocial distancing policies were enacted during March 2020 to limit the spread of COVID-19. Lockdowns and movement restrictions increased the potential of negative impact on population mental health, in which depression and anxiety symptoms were frequently reported by different population groups during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the causal relationship of mitigation policies on national-wide mental health treatment is lacking.

ObjectiveThis study investigates the effect of COVID-19 mitigation measures on mental health across the United States, on county and state levels. It examines the effect on the total mental health patients, different age and gender groups, and patients of selected mental health diagnoses.

MethodsWe used large-scale medical claims data for mental health patients dated from September 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, with publicly available state- and county-specific COVID-19 cases from first case in January to December 31, 2020, and used publicly available lockdown dates data for states and counties. We designed a difference-in-differences (DID) model, which infers the causal effect of a policy intervention by comparing pre-policy and post-policy periods in different regions. We mainly focused on two types of social distancing policies, stay-at-home and school closure orders.

ResultsBased on common pre-treatment trend assumption of regions, we find that lockdown has significantly and causally increased seeking medical treatment for mental health across counties and states. Mental health patients in regions with lockdown orders have significantly increased by 18% compared to 1% decline in regions without a lockdown. Also, female populations have been exposed to a larger lockdown effect on their mental health with 24% increase in regions with lockdowns compared to 3% increase in regions without. While male mental health patients decreased by 5% in regions without lockdowns. Patients diagnosed with panic disorders and reaction to severe stress both were significantly exposed to a significant large effect of lockdowns. Also, life management difficulty patients doubled in regions with stay-at-home orders but increased less with school closures. Contrarily, attention-deficit hyperactivity patients declined in regions without stay-at-home orders. The number of mental health patients older than 80 decreased in regions with lockdowns. Adults between (21 - 40) years old were exposed to the greatest lockdown effect with patient number increasing between 20% to 30% in regions with lockdown. Adolescent patients under 21 increased in regions with school closures.

ConclusionAlthough non-pharmaceutical intervention policies were effective in containing the spread of COVID-19, our results show that mitigation policies led to population-wide increase in mental health patients. Our results suggest the need for greater mental health treatment resources in the face of lockdown policies.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsTo assess TNF-antagonist therapy, 18 hospitalized adults with hypoxic respiratory failure and COVID-19 pneumonia received single-dose infliximab-abda therapy 5mg/kg intravenously between April and December 2020. The primary endpoint was time to increase in oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) by [&ge;] 50 compared to baseline and sustained for 48 hours. Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality, dynamic cytokine profiles (Human Cytokine 48-Plex Discovery Assay, Eve Technologies), secondary infections, duration of supplemental oxygen support and hospitalization.

FindingsPatients were predominantly in critical respiratory failure (15/18, 83%), male (14/18, 78%), above 60 years (median 63 yrs, range 31-80), race-ethnic minorities (13/18, 72%), lymphopenic (13/18, 72%), steroid-treated (17/18, 94%), with a median ferritin of 1953ng/ml. Sixteen patients (89%) met the primary endpoint within a median of 4 days, 15/18 (83%) recovered from respiratory failure, and 14/18 (78%) were discharged in a median of 8 days and were alive at 28-day follow-up. Deaths among three patients [&ge;] 65yrs age with pre-existing lung disease or multiple comorbidities were attributed to secondary lung infection. Mean plasma IP-10 levels declined sharply from 9183 pg/ml to 483 pg/ml at Day 3 and further to 146 pg/ml at Day 14/discharge. Significant declines in IFN-{gamma}, TNF, IL-27, CRP and ferritin were specifically observed at Day 3 whereas other cytokines were unmodified. IL-6 levels declined sharply among patients with baseline levels >10 pg/ml. Among 13 lymphopenic patients, six (46%) had resolution of lymphopenia by day 3, and 11 by day 14. CXCR3-ligand (IP-10 and CXCL-9) declines were strongly correlated among patients with lymphopenia reversal (Day 3, Pearson r: 0.98, p-value: 0.0006).

InterpretationConsistent with a pathophysiological role of TNF, the clinical and cytokine data indicate that infliximab-abda may rapidly abrogate pathological inflammatory signaling to facilitate clinical recovery in severe and critical COVID-19. Randomized studies are required to formally assess mortality outcomes. Funding: National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences",NA,medrxiv

Patients and MethodsAfter IRB approval, we reviewed the charts of 107 patients seen between January 19, 2021 and April 29, 2021 in the Mayo Clinic Post COVID Care Clinic (PCOCC) in order to describe the first 107 patients treated through the Mayo Clinic PCOCC. Data was abstracted from the electronic medical record into a standardized database to facilitate analysis. Phenotypes of patients seen in the PCOCC clinic were identified by expert review of predominant symptom clusters.

ResultsThe majority of patients seen in our clinic were female (75%, 80/107), and the median age at presentation was 47 years (interquartile range [IQR] 37, 55). All had Post Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) with six clinical phenotypes being identified - fatigue predominant (n=68), dyspnea predominant (n=23), myalgia predominant (n=6), orthostasis predominant (n=6), chest pain predominant (n=3), and headache predominant (n=1). The fatigue-predominant phenotype was more common in women (84%, p=0.006) and the dyspnea-predominant phenotype was more common in men (52%, p=0.002). IL-6 was elevated in 61% of patients (69% of women, p=0.0046) which was statistically discordant with elevation in CRP and ESR which was identified in 17% and 20% of cases respectively (p<0.001). Four PASC phenotypes (fatigue-predominant, myalgia-predominant, orthostasis predominant, and headache-predominant) were associated with central sensitization (CS), and higher IL-6 levels than those phenotypes not associated with CS (p=0.013). Patients with CS phenotypes after COVID-19 infection (post COVID syndrome) were predominantly female (80%, p=0.0085).

ConclusionIn our post COVID clinic, we observed several distinct clinical phenotypes. Fatigue-predominance was the most common presentation and was associated with elevated IL-6 levels and female gender. Dyspnea-predominance was more common in men and was not associated with elevated IL-6 levels. IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in patients with PASC and discordant with ESR and CRP, particularly in those with central sensitization phenotypes.",NA,medrxiv

The method revealed a limit of detection of 19.3 {+/-} 2.7 viral genomic copies/L when using RNA extracted samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs collected in guanidine-containing viral transport medium. Typical RT-LAMP reactions were performed at 65 {o}C for 30 min.

Prenatal depression has been associated with adverse birth and child development outcomes. DNA methylation (DNAm) may aid in understanding this association. In this project, we analyzed associations between prenatal depression and DNAm from cord blood from participants of the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. We examined DNAm in an epigenome wide association study (EWAS) of 248 mother child pairs. DNAm was measured using the Infinium MethylationEPIC (N=145) and the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (N=103) arrays. Prenatal depression scores, obtained with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), were analyzed as continuous and dichotomized variables. We used linear robust models to estimate associations between depression and newborn DNAm, adjusted for measured (smoking status, household income, sex, preterm birth, cell type proportions, and genetic principal components) and unmeasured confounding using Cate and Bacon algorithms. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing. DMRcate was used to test for differentially methylated regions (DMRs).

Changing weather conditions such as temperature and humidity are known to affect virus transmission, but we consider the possibility that an intrinsic rhythm in susceptibility, entrained to annual cues, also contributes to seasonality. These two mechanisms produce different predictions about how the timing and amplitude of seasonal disease depend on environmental forcing. Using databases of health insurance claims and weather across U.S. counties, we find that the timing of winter-peaking diseases, but not their amplitude, scales with latitude. This latitude scaling is shared across many diagnosis codes involving multiple pathogens. Regression against simple models suggests an underlying limit cycle that, in temperate zones, is entrained to annual changes in irradiance, possibly a human circannual clock.

Main outcome and measureDescriptive part: prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions in general and discouraged drug pairs in particular during admissions. Adverse outcomes part: post-discharge all-cause mortality rate, readmission rate and length-of-stay.

ResultsAmong 2,886,227 hospital admissions (945,475 patients; median age 62 years [IQR: 41-74]; 54% female; median number of drugs 7 [IQR: 4-11]), patients in 1,836,170 admissions were exposed to at least one potential drug-drug interaction (659,525 patients; median age 65 years [IQR: 49-77]; 54% female; median number of drugs 9 [IQR: 6-13]), and in 27,605 admissions to a discouraged drug pair (18,192 patients; median age 68 years [IQR: 58-77]; female 46%; median number of drugs 16 [IQR: 11-22]).

Main outcome measuresRT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 related admissions within 14 days after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, all-cause admission, COVID-19 related death within 30 days after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and all-cause death.

ResultsBeyond 7 days after the second dose, the VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection in all groups ranged from 53-86%. In 65PHC, HCW and SCD, we observed a substantial reduction in risk of infection 0-7 days after the second dose ranging from 46-71%. The VE against COVID-19 related admissions ranged from 75-87% in all groups except +85 and HCWs where no events occurred. For COVID-19 related deaths, a significant VE was observed in LTCF residents (VE of 89%) and 65PHC (VE of 97%), whereas no events were observed in the three remaining groups. VE against all-cause death ranged from 26-73% in all groups except HCW where an insignificant VE was estimated. For all-cause admission, the VE ranged from 37-50% in all groups except in SCD where a negative VE was observed.

ConclusionIn a real-life setting and more than 7 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA was administered to the most vulnerable individuals, the vaccine was associated with a reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection (53-86%) and COVID-19 related admissions ([&ge;]75%) or deaths ([&ge;]89%).",NA,medrxiv

There is less evidence on how COVID-19 prevalence varies by measures of work and occupation which represent a key social determinant of health. The aim of the study is to evaluate how occupational inequalities in the prevalence of COVID-19 varies across England and their possible explanatory factors.

MethodsWe used data for 363,651 individuals (2,178,835 observations) aged 18 years and over between 1st May 2020 and 31st January 2021 from the ONS Covid Infection Survey, a representative longitudinal survey of individuals in England. We focus on two measures of work; employment status for all adults, and work sector of individuals currently working. Multi-level binomial regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of testing positive of COVID-19, adjusting for known explanatory covariates.

Results0.9% of participants tested positive for COVID-19 over the study period. COVID-19 prevalence was higher among adults who were students or furloughed (i.e., temporarily not working). Among adults currently working, COVID-19 prevalence was highest in adults employed in the hospitality sector, with higher prevalence for individuals employed in transport, social care, retail, health care and educational sectors. Inequalities by work were not consistent over time.

ConclusionsWe find an unequal distribution of infections relating to COVID-19 by work and employment status. Our findings demonstrate the need for greater workplace interventions to protect employees, but also that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs outside of work. In particular, populations who experienced social and economic harms through being furloughed were also more likely to experience a double burden of increased likelihood of COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

Effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19 are essential to achieve global control of the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but multiple factors, including vaccine supply and vaccine confidence, will be key for high rates of global uptake. Confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, socio-demographic status, and recent emotional status are likely to be key drivers of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. In this study, we explore these determinants of COVID-19 vaccination intent across17 countries worldwide.

MethodsIn this large-scale multi-country study, we explore intent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine and the socio-demographic and emotional determinants of uptake for 17 countries and over 19,000 individuals surveyed in June and July 2020 via nationally representative samples. We used Bayesian ordinal logistic regressions to probe the relationship between intent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine and individuals socio-demographic status, their confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and their recent emotional status. Gibbs sampling was used for Bayesian model inference, with 95% Bayesian highest posterior density intervals used to capture uncertainty.

FindingsIntent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine is highest in India, where 77.8% (95% HPD, 75.5 to 80.0%) of respondents strongly agreeing that they would take a new COVID-19 vaccine if it were available. The Democratic Republic of Congo (15.5%, 12.2 to 18.6%) and France (26.4%, 23.7 to 29.2%) have the lowest share of respondents who strongly agree that they would accept a COVID-19. Confidence in the safety, importance, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines are the most widely informative determinants of vaccination intent. Socio-demographic and emotional determinants played a lesser role, with being male and having higher education was associated with increased uptake intent in five countries and being fearful of catching COVID-19 also a strong determinant of uptake intent.

InterpretationBarriers to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance will be highly country and context dependent. These findings highlight the importance of regular monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine confidence to identify groups less likely to vaccinate and to monitor the impact of vaccination policies on uptake behaviour.",NA,medrxiv

So far, our understanding of the contribution of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells is incomplete, particularly in the context of the recently described peripheral helper T-cell subset (TPH). Here, using single cell sequencing and multi-parameter flow cytometry, we show that cytotoxic CD4+ T cells are enriched in synovial fluid of anti-citrullinated peptides antibody (ACPA)-positive RA patients. We identify two distinct TPH states differentially characterized by the expression of CXCL13 and PRDM1, respectively. Our data reveal that the adhesion G-Protein Coupled Receptor 56 (GPR56), a marker of circulating cytotoxic cells, delineates the synovial TPH CD4+ T-cell subset. At the site of inflammation, GPR56+CD4+ T cells expressed the tissue-resident memory markers LAG-3, CXCR6 and CD69. Further, TCR clonality analysis revealed that most expanded clones in SF are contained within the cytotoxic and the CXCL13+ TPH CD4+ T-cell populations. Finally, the detection of common TCRs between the two TPH and cytotoxic CD4+ T-cell clusters suggest a shared differentiation. Our study provides comprehensive immunoprofiling of the heterogenous T-cell subsets at the site of inflammation in ACPA+ RA and suggests GPR56 as a therapeutic target to modulate TPH cells and cytotoxic CD4+ T cell function.",NA,medrxiv

Material and methodsCross-sectional analytical design study where the 2019 Peruvian Demographic and Family Health Survey was analyzed. The association was evaluated using Poisson Regression, supplemented with the crude prevalence ratio (cPR) and adjusted (aPR).

ResultsThe records of 18,401 women were evaluated, where 5.39% (95%CI:4.83-6.03%) presented home birth. The probability of a home birth occurs increases when the pregnant woman is from the andean (aPR:1.24; 95%CI:1.02-1.48) and amazon region (aPR:1.38; 95%CI:1.16-1.64), resides in rural areas (aPR:3.34; 95%CI:2.61-4.29), presents less than 6 prenatal care (aPR:1.66; 95%CI:1.39 -1.96), it is very poor (aPR:9.62; 95%CI:5.13-18.1) or poor (aPR:2.39; 95%CI:1.26-4.52), it has not studied (aPR:2.66; 95%CI:2.02-3.50) or reached primary education (aPR:2.18: 95%CI:1.85-2.58) and has 2 children (aPR:1.64; 95%CI:1.46-1.85) or 3 or more children (aPR:2.18; 95%CI:1.67-2.87).

A clinical service, COVID Oximetry @home (CO@h) was launched in November 2020 to support remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients in the community. Remote monitoring through CO@h aims to identify early patient deterioration and provide timely escalation for cases of silent hypoxia, while reducing the burden on secondary care.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective service evaluation of COVID-19 patients onboarded to CO@h from November 2020 to March 2021 in the North Hampshire (UK) community led service (a collaboration of 15 GP practices, covering a population of 230,000 people). We have compared outcomes for patients admitted to Basingstoke & North Hampshire Hospital who were CO@h patients (COVID-19 patients with monitoring of SpO2 (n=137)), with non CO@h patients (those directly admitted without being monitored by CO@h (n=633)). Odds Ratio analysis was performed to contrast the likelihood of patient outcomes resulting in 30 day mortality, ICU admission and length of stay greater than 3, 7, 14, and 28 days.

ResultsHospital length of stay was reduced by an average of 6.3 days for CO@h patients (6.9 95% CI [5.6 - 8.1]) in comparison to Non-CO@h (13.2 95% CI [12.2 - 14.1]). The most significant odds ratio effect was on mortality (0.23 95%CI [0.11 - 0.49]), followed by length of stay > 14 days (OR 0.23 95%CI [0.13 - 0.42]), length of stay > 28 days (OR 0.23 95%CI [0.08 - 0.65]), length of stay > 7 days (OR 0.35 95%CI [0.24 - 0.52]), and length of stay > 3 days (OR 0.52 95%CI [0.35 - 0.78]). Mortality and length of stay outcomes were statistically significant. Only 5/137 (3.6%) where admitted to ICU compared with 52/633 (8.2%) for Non-CO@h.

Abacavir can trigger a severe hypersensitivity reaction in people who are homozygous or heterozygous for HLA-B*57:01. Testing for HLA-B*57:01 prior to abacavir initiation is standard-of-care in high-resource settings, but current tests are too costly for resource-limited settings. To address this gap, we developed an inexpensive, simple-to-use rapid assay to detect HLA-B*57:01.

MethodsWe designed and optimized a multiplexed PCR to amplify HLA-B*57 subtypes and the human beta-globin gene. Subsequently, probes annealed to the amplicon and were ligated when specific for the HLA-B*57:01 allele. Ligated products were detected by immunocapture in a lateral flow strip. Cell lines with known HLA genotypes were used to optimize the assay. The assay was then evaluated by comparing the genotype of clinical specimens (n=60) enriched for individuals with HLA-B*57:01 by the new assay to that from sequencing.

ResultsThe optimized multiplex PCR for B*57 and beta-globin resulted in a 40-minute, 35-cycle amplification, followed by a 20-minute ligation reaction and 15-minute detection step. Evaluation of the HLA-B*57:01 oligonucleotide ligation assay using clinical specimens had a sensitivity of 100% (n=27/27 typed as B*57:01) and specificity of 100% (n=33/33 typed as non-B*57:01) by visual interpretation of lateral flow strips.

ConclusionsThis rapid and economical assay can accurately detect the presence of HLA-B*57:01 in clinical specimens. Use of this assay could expand access to HLA-B*57:01 genotyping and facilitate safe same-day initiation of abacavir-based treatment.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe estimated the incidence of CHIKV infection among children hospitalised with neurological disease in coastal Kenya. We used reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to systematically test for CHIKV in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from children aged <16 years hospitalised with symptoms of neurological disease at Kilifi County Hospital between January 2014 and December 2018. Clinical records were linked to the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System and population incidence rates of CHIKV infection estimated.

FindingsThere were 18,341 paediatric admissions during the 5-year study period, of which 4,332 (24%) had CSF collected. The most common clinical reasons for CSF collection were impaired consciousness, seizures and coma (47%, 22% and 21% of all collections, respectively).

MethodsHere we present a clinical evaluation and real-world implementation of the INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (INDICAID Rapid Test). A multi-site clinical evaluation of the INDICAID Rapid Test using prospectively collected samples from symptomatic subjects was performed. The INDICAID Rapid Test was then implemented at COVID-19 outbreak screening centers in Hong Kong to screen individuals for COVID-19 to prioritize confirmatory RT-PCR testing among asymptomatic populations.

ResultsThe clinical evaluation in symptomatic patient populations demonstrated a positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of 85.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 75.6% - 91.6%) and 94.9% (95% CI: 91.6% - 96.9%), respectively, when compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing. When used during outbreak testing of 22,994 asymptomatic patients, the INDICAID Rapid Test demonstrated a positive percent agreement of 84.2% (95% CI: 69.6% - 92.6%) and a negative percent agreement of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.9% - 100%) compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing.

The risk of infection and optimal preventive strategies for health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic remain poorly understood. Here we report the results of a weekly testing regime that has been performed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify pre- and asymptomatic healthcare workers. Based on these observations we have developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that integrates the sources of infection from inside and outside the hospital. The data were used to study how regular testing and a desynchronisation protocol are effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 infection at work, and compared both strategies in terms of workforce availability and cost-effectiveness. We showed that case incidence among healthcare workers is higher than would be explained solely by community infection. Furthermore, while testing and desynchronisation protocols are both effective in preventing nosocomial transmission, regular testing maintains work productivity with implementation costs.",NA,medrxiv

This means of monitoring for outbreaks has been used at municipal wastewater treatment centers to analyze COVID-19 trends in entire communities, as well as by universities and other community living environments to monitor COVID-19 spread in buildings. Sample concentration is crucial, especially when viral abundance in raw wastewater is below the threshold of detection by RT-qPCR analysis. We evaluated the performance of a rapid ultrafiltration-based virus concentration method using InnovaPrep Cp Select pipette tips and compared this to the established electronegative membrane filtration (EMF) method. We evaluated sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 quantification, surrogate virus recovery rate, and sample processing time. Results suggest that the Cp Select concentrator is more efficient at concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater compared to the EMF method. 30% of samples that tested negative when concentrated with the EMF method produced a positive signal with the Cp Select protocol. Increased recovery of the surrogate virus control using the Cp Select confirms this observation. We optimized the Cp Select protocol by adding AVL lysis buffer and sonication, to increase the recovery of virus. Sonication increased BCoV recovery by 19%, which seems to compensate for viral loss during centrifugation. Filtration time decreases by approximately 30% when using the Cp Select protocol, making this an optimal choice for building surveillance applications where quick turnaround time is necessary.

We investigated the humoral response to vaccination in 53 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), or CLL patients. Peripheral blood was obtained 2 weeks after first vaccination and 6 weeks after second vaccination for antibody profiling using the multiplex bead-binding assay. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody levels to the spike specific receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated as a measure of response. Subsequently, antibody-positive serum were assayed for neutralization capacity against authentic SARS-CoV-2. Histology was 68% lymphoma and 32% CLL; groups were: patients receiving anti-CD20-based therapy (45%), monitored with disease (28%), receiving BTK inhibitors (19%), or chemotherapy (all HL) (8%). SARS-CoV-2 specific RBD IgG antibody response was decreased across all NHL and CLL groups: 25%, 73%, and 40%, respectively. Antibody IgG titers were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) for CD20 treated and targeted therapy patients, and (p = 0.003) for monitored patients. In 94% of patients evaluated after first and second vaccination, antibody titers did not significantly boost after second vaccination. Only 13% of CD20 treated and 13% of monitored patients generated neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with ICD50s 135 to 1767, and 445 and > 10240. This data has profound implications given the current guidance relaxing masking restrictions and for timing of vaccinations. Unless immunity is confirmed with laboratory testing, these patients should continue to mask, socially distance, and to avoid close contact with non-vaccinated individuals.

Statement of Translational RelevanceNon Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic Lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients who are treated with anti-CD20 antibody therapy, BTK inhibitor therapy, or who are monitored with active disease, have decreased antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and decreased antibody titers compared to healthy controls. Antibody titers do not boost following second vaccination, and very few patients generate neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This data is of particular importance, given the recent guidance from the CDC that vaccinated patients no longer need to be masked indoors as well as outdoors. Patients with NHL or CLL who fall into these categories should not consider their immunity from vaccination to be assured. If infected with SARS-CoV-2, they should be a high priority for monoclonal antibody directed therapy. Unless immune response to vaccination is confirmed with laboratory testing, they should continue to mask, socially distance, and to avoid close contact with non-vaccinated individuals.",NA,medrxiv

Comparison with the estimated reproduction number of B.1.1.7 enables an estimate of the increased transmissibility of B.1.617.2. We conclude that it is almost certain that there is increased transmissibility that will rapidly lead to B.1.617.2 becoming the prevailing variant in the UK.

We are also reporting that the percentage of neutralization correlates with the IgG titers and that in the first collected samples, IgG1 was the predominant isotype (62.71%), followed by IgG4 (15.25%), IgG3 (13.56%), and IgG2 (8.47%) during the tested period. The IgA was detectable in 28.81% of subjects. Only 62.71% of all subjects have detectable IgM in the first sample despite of confirmed infection by a molecular method. Our data suggests that 100% that seroconvert make detectable neutralizing antibody responses measured by a surrogate viral neutralization test. We also found that the IgG titers and neutralizing activity were higher after the first dose in 10 vaccinated subjects out of the 59 with prior infection compare to a subgroup of 21 subjects naive to SARS-CoV-2. One dose was enough but two were necessary to reach the maximum percentage of neutralization in subjects with previous natural infection or naive to SARS-CoV-2 respectively. Like the pattern seen after the natural infection, after the second vaccine dose, the total anti-S antibodies and titers declined but not the neutralizing activity which remains at same levels for more than 80 days after the first vaccine dose. That decline, however, was significantly lower in pre-exposed individuals which denotes the contribution of the natural infection priming a more robust immune response to the vaccine. Also, our data indicates that the natural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response than the first vaccine dose in unexposed subjects. However, the difference was significant only when the neutralization was measured but not by assessing the total anti-S antibodies or the IgG titers. This work is an important contribution to understand the natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely hit by the virus. Also provide an invaluable data by comparing the dynamic of the immune response after the natural infection vs. the vaccination and suggesting that a functional test is a better marker than the presence or not of antibodies. On this context our results are also highly relevant to consider standardizing methods that in addition to serve as a tool to follow up the immune response to the vaccines may also provide a correlate of protection.",NA,medrxiv

We used multivariable Mendelian randomization to compare the direct effects of total adiposity (using body mass index (BMI)) and abdominal adiposity (using waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR)) on circulating lipoproteins, lipids, and metabolites with a five-fold increase in sample size over previous studies.

MethodsWe used new metabolic data on 109,532 UK Biobank participants. BMI and WHR were measured in 2006-2010, during which EDTA plasma was collected. Plasma samples were used in 2019-2020 to quantify 249 metabolic traits with high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy including subclass-specific lipoprotein concentrations, apolipoprotein B, cholesterol and triglycerides, plus pre-glycemic and inflammatory metabolites. We used two-stage least squares regression models with genetic risk scores for BMI and WHR as instruments to estimate the total (unadjusted) and direct (mutually adjusted) effects of BMI and WHR on metabolic traits. We also estimated the effects of BMI and WHR on statin use, and examined interaction of main effects by sex, statin use, and age as a proxy for medication use.

ResultsHigher BMI (per standard deviation (SD) or 4.8 kg/m2) was estimated to moderately decrease apolipoprotein B and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol before and after adjustment for WHR, whilst higher BMI increased triglycerides before but not after WHR adjustment. Estimated effects of higher WHR (per SD, or 0.090 ratio-unit) on lipoproteins, lipids, and metabolites were often larger than those of BMI, but null for LDL cholesterol, and attenuations were minimal upon adjustment for BMI. Patterns of effect estimates differed by sex, e.g., only BMI independently increased triglycerides among men, whereas only WHR independently increased triglycerides among women. Higher BMI and WHR (per SD) were each estimated to directly increase the relative odds of using statins (by 3.49 (95% CI = 3.42, 3.57) times higher for WHR). These patterns were most pronounced among women, and there was strong evidence that the effects of BMI and WHR on metabolic traits differed by statin use and age. Among the youngest adults (38-53 years, statin use 5%), higher BMI and WHR (per SD) each modestly increased LDL cholesterol (0.04 SD, 95% CI = -0.01, 0.08 for total effect of BMI and 0.10 SD, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.17 for total effect of WHR). This estimate for BMI fully attenuated, and the estimate for WHR remained unchanged, upon mutual adjustment. These direct effects on LDL cholesterol were more inverse for BMI and less positive for WHR at intermediate ages (54-62 years, statins 17%) and older ages (63-73 years, statins 29%) where the mutually adjusted effects of BMI and WHR on LDL cholesterol had reversed to -0.19 SD (95% CI = -0.27, -0.11) and -0.05 SD (95% CI = -0.16, 0.06), respectively.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that abdominal adiposity has a dominant role in driving the metabolic harms of excess adiposity, particularly among women. Our findings also suggest that apparent effects of adiposity on lowering LDL cholesterol are explained by an effect of adiposity on statin use.",NA,medrxiv

Beta-amyloid (A{beta}) is a cytotoxic protein that deposits in the brain many years prior to the onset of cognitive dysfunction. The preclinical period is a stage of AD in which significant pathology is present without clinical symptoms. A{beta} has been shown to deposit asymmetrically early in the AD trajectory, which has shown to have functional consequences (e.g., asymmetric hypometabolism). We aimed to investigate whether markers of AD and cognitive function were correlated with neural activation asymmetry during memory encoding tasks.

MethodsWe recruited participants who were cognitively normal to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and cognitive testing. We conducted analyses to identify regions of significant activation during a well-established face-name pair memory encoding task, and to identify regions of significant asymmetry. We then computed hemispheric asymmetry (negative/positive values indicate left/right asymmetry, respectively) and absolute asymmetry (greater values indicate greater asymmetry in either hemisphere) and investigated their associations with age, sex, education, global cerebral amyloid, global cerebral metabolism, memory encoding task performance, white matter hyperintensities, and multiple domains of cognitive function.

ResultsWe identified expected regions of significant activation, including the hippocampus, and identified four regions with significant left-hemisphere asymmetry: superior medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, supplemental motor area, and medial orbitofrontal gyrus, and two regions with significant right hemisphere asymmetry: putamen and ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. We found that greater left-hemisphere asymmetry in the middle frontal gyrus was correlated with greater global cerebral glucose metabolism. We also found that better performance in memory, learning, and executive attention was associated with greater absolute symmetry in the thalamus, while better visuospatial performance was associated with greater putamen absolute symmetry.

Beta-amyloid (A{beta}) is a cytotoxic protein that deposits in the brain many years prior to the onset of cognitive dysfunction. The preclinical period is a stage of AD in which significant pathology is present without clinical symptoms. A{beta} has been shown to deposit asymmetrically early in the AD trajectory, which has shown to have functional consequences (e.g., asymmetric hypometabolism). We aimed to investigate whether markers of AD and cognitive function were correlated with neural activation asymmetry during memory encoding tasks.

MethodsWe recruited participants who were cognitively normal to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and cognitive testing. We conducted analyses to identify regions of significant activation during a well-established face-name pair memory encoding task, and to identify regions of significant asymmetry. We then computed hemispheric asymmetry (negative/positive values indicate left/right asymmetry, respectively) and absolute asymmetry (greater values indicate greater asymmetry in either hemisphere) and investigated their associations with age, sex, education, global cerebral amyloid, global cerebral metabolism, memory encoding task performance, white matter hyperintensities, and multiple domains of cognitive function.

ResultsWe identified expected regions of significant activation, including the hippocampus, and identified four regions with significant left-hemisphere asymmetry: superior medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, supplemental motor area, and medial orbitofrontal gyrus, and two regions with significant right hemisphere asymmetry: putamen and ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. We found that greater left-hemisphere asymmetry in the middle frontal gyrus was correlated with greater global cerebral glucose metabolism. We also found that better performance in memory, learning, and executive attention was associated with greater absolute symmetry in the thalamus, while better visuospatial performance was associated with greater putamen absolute symmetry.

DiscussionFunctional asymmetry is correlated with functional markers (e.g., glucose metabolism) in older cognitively normal adults and may reflect metabolic and cognitive changes.

However, little is known about the role of VDR gene polymorphism with obesity in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate VDR gene TaqI, ApaI and FokI SNPs in overweight/obese HD patients.

MethodsSeventy one normal weight and 68 overweight/obese HD patients were included in study. PCR-RFLP method was used for genotyping. Demographic and laboratory data obtained from medical records of patients.

ResultsFor all three SNPs, no significant association was found between normal and overweight/obese patients (P>0.05). Lower HDL concentrations and higher levels of triglyceride (TG) and glucose were detected in the obese/overweight patients compared to normal weight (p<0.001 for HDL, and TG and p=0.023 for glucose). In obese/overweight patients, subjects with CC genotype of TaqI showed higher PTH level (717.1{+/-}616.4 pg/ml) than those TC genotype (342.7{+/-}360.8 pg/ml) and TT genotype (310.2{+/-}323.4 pg/ml) (p=0.028); higher TG level was found in patients with CC genotype of ApaI (627.3{+/-}653.0 mg/dl) compared to AA (223.3{+/-}156.6) and AC genotypes (193.1{+/-}85.4) (p<0.001). Obese/overweight patients carrying FokI TT genotype had higher glucose concentration compared to those carrying CC and CT genotypes (CC=183.4{+/-}128.4 mg/dl; TT=151.9{+/-}66.1 mg/dl; CT=107.6{+/-}41.9 mg/dl, p=0.008).

ConclusionsOur study suggest that VDR TaqI, ApaI and FokI polymorphisms are not associated with obesity in HD patients. However, they might be increase the risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, which are among the most common obesity related comorbidities of chronic kidney disease.",NA,medrxiv

Immunogenetic patterns associated with self-antigenic presentation remain unclear. Herein we analyzed the molecular landscape of HLA complexes and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of a large cohort of IAA patients and controls. We show that antigen binding sites of class II HLA molecules in IAA are characterized by a high level of structural homology, only partially explained by specific risk allele profiles, implying reduced binding capabilities compared to controls. Few amino acids within the synapsis HLA-DRB1-antigen-TCR, are identified as strongly associated with IAA phenotype. Those structural patterns may affect TCR repertoires, promoting immunological cross-reactivity and autoimmunity. These findings inform on the immunogenetic risk associated with IAA and on general pathophysiological mechanisms potentially involved in autoimmunity.

The brain mechanisms supporting FAPD remain poorly understood. This investigation examined the neuromechanisms of FAPD during a well-tolerated visceral pain induction task, the water load symptom provocation task (WL-SPT). Youth between the ages of 11 and 17 years participated. Functional connectivity (FC) was examined via the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) effect using the left and right amygdala (AMY) as seed regions. Relationships of the time courses within these seeds with voxels across the whole brain were evaluated. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) was used to assess regional brain activation by examining cerebral blood flow. Increased FC between the left AMY with regions associated with nociceptive processing (e.g., thalamus), and right AMY FC changes with areas associated with cognitive functioning (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the default mode network (DMN; parietal lobe) were observed in youth with FAPD following the WL-SPT. These changes were related to changes in pain unpleasantness. AMY FC changes post WL-SPT were also related to changes in pain intensity. AMY FC with the DMN in youth with FAPD also differed from healthy controls. Global CBF changes were also noted between FAPD and controls, but no significant differences in grey matter were detected either between groups or during the WL-SPT in youth with FAPD. Findings confirm youth with FAPD have changes in brain connectivity that could support the development of biomarkers to enhance understanding of the mechanisms of pain and treatment response.",NA,medrxiv

Ample evidence indicates that risk for OUD is heritable. As a surrogate (or proxy) for OUD, we explored the genetic basis of using opioids  not as prescribed. We hypothesized that misuse of opiates might be a heritable risk factor for OUD. To test this hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of problematic opioid use (POU;  ever taking opioid prescriptions not as prescribed) in 132,113 23andMe research participants of European ancestry (Ncases=27,805). Our GWAS identified two genome-wide significant loci (rs3791033, an intronic variant of KDM4A; rs640561, an intergenic variant near LRRIQ3). POU showed a positive genetic correlation with opioid dependence and OUD, as measured in the largest available GWAS (rg=0.57-0.80). We also identified numerous additional genetic correlations with POU, including alcohol dependence (rg=0.74), smoking initiation (rg=0.63), pain relief medication intake (rg=0.49), major depressive disorder (rg=0.44), chronic pain (rg=0.42), insomnia (rg=0.39), and loneliness (rg=0.28). Although POU was positively genetically correlated with risk-taking (rg=0.38), conditioning POU on risk-taking did not substantially alter the magnitude or direction of these genetic correlations, suggesting that POU does not simply reflect a general tendency for risky behavior. We conclude that opioid misuse can be measured in population-based cohorts and provides a cost-effective complementary strategy for understanding the genetic basis of OUD.",NA,medrxiv

However, of these four countries, only Ethiopia has introduced human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination at the national level in 2018 and India in a few states in 2016. Our study objective was to estimate the potential health impact of HPV vaccination among ten cohorts of 9-year-old girls from 2021-2030 in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan using two independent mathematical models, and assess similarities and differences in vaccine impact projections through comparative modelling analysis.

MethodsUsing two widely published models (Harvard and PRIME) to estimate HPV vaccination impact, we simulated a vaccination scenario of 90% annual coverage among 9-year-old girls from 2021-2030 in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. We estimated the potential health impact in terms of cervical cancer cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted among vaccinated cohorts from the time of vaccination until 2100. We also conducted a comparative modelling analysis to understand the differences in vaccine impact estimates generated by the two models.

ResultsPrior to harmonising model assumptions, the range between the PRIME model and the Harvard model for the potential health impact of HPV vaccination in terms of the number of cervical cancer cases averted among girls vaccinated 2021-2030 between the year of vaccination and 2100 was: 262,000 to 270,000 in Ethiopia; 1,640,000 to 1,970,000 in India; 330,000 to 336,000 in Nigeria; and 111,000 to 133,000 in Pakistan. When harmonising model assumptions, alignment on HPV type distribution significantly narrowed the differences in vaccine impact estimates.

ConclusionsThe main difference in estimates for cases, deaths, and DALYs averted by vaccination between the models are due to variation in interpretation around data on cervical cancer attribution to HPV-16/18; differences in estimates for DALYs averted are additionally due to differences in age-specific remaining life expectancy over time between the two models. As countries make progress towards the World Health Organization targets for cervical cancer elimination, continued explorations of underlying differences in model inputs, assumptions, and results when examining cervical cancer prevention policy will be critical.",NA,medrxiv

Nevertheless, positive physiological alternations induced by pre-cooling gradually disappear during exercise. Hence, there is a great need to find effective per-cooling strategies to improve athletic performance in the heat. Unfortunately, its impractical to adopt pre-cooling approaches as a per-cooling modality to improve athletic performance due to inherent issues of practicality. Thus, a narrative review was conducted to examine the impact of head, neck and facial cooling on athletic performance in the heat. Based on current evidences, head, neck and facial cooling could greatly decrease local skin temperature at those areas where cooling was applied and thereby, local perceptual sensations were greatly enhanced. Neck cooling during exercise is found effective to improve athletic performance for both endurance and team sports athletes in the heat. Besides, neck cooling is preferred over the head, facial & combined head/facial & neck cooling for both endurance and team sport athletes in the heat from a practical application viewpoint. Research is lacking on the systematically selection of per-cooling modalities to improve athletic performance based on environmental conditions and nature of the sports activity. In addition, powerful but portable head, neck and facial cooling systems are urgently required to help athletes improving performance in the heat.

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a blood conservation strategy associated with variable success, and rarely studied in more complex cardiac procedures. The study aim was to evaluate whether acute ANH improves coagulopathy and reduces blood transfusions in thoracic aortic surgeries.

MethodsSingle-center observational cohort study comparing ANH and standard institutional practice in patients who underwent thoracic aortic repair from 2019 to 2021.

Results89 patients underwent ANH and 116 standard practice. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of demographic or major perioperative characteristics. In the ANH group coagulation tests before and after transfusion of autologous blood showed decreased INR and increased platelets, fibrinogen, all with p<0.0005. Coagulation results in the ANH and control groups were not statistically different. The average number of transfused allogeneic products per patient was lower in the ANH vs control group: FFP 1.1 {+/-}1.6 vs 1.9 {+/-}2.3 (p=0.003), platelets 0.6 {+/-}0.8 vs 1.2 {+/-}1.3 (p=0.0008), and cryoprecipitate 0.3 {+/-}0.7 vs 0.7 {+/-}1.1 (p=0.008). Reduction in RBC transfusion was not statistically significant. The percentage of patients who received any transfusion was 53.9% in ANH and 59.5% in the control group (p=0.42). There was no significant difference in major adverse outcomes.

ConclusionsANH is a safe blood conservation strategy for surgical repairs of the thoracic aorta. Laboratory data suggests that ANH can improve coagulopathy after separation from CPB, and significantly reduce the number of transfused FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate.",NA,medrxiv

This may explain counterintuitive results, where exposures that are known to be harmful for mortality risk sometimes seem protective for the risk of dementia. Authors have attempted to explain these counterintuitive results as biased, but the bias associated with a particular analytic method cannot be defined or assessed if the causal question is not explicitly specified. Indeed, we can consider several causal questions when competing events like death, which cannot be prevented by design, are present. Current dementia research guidelines have not explicitly considered what constitutes a meaningful causal question in this setting or, more generally, how this choice justifies and should drive particular analytic decisions. To contextualize current practices, we first perform a systematic review of the conduct and interpretation of longitudinal studies focused on dementia outcomes where death is a competing event. We then describe and demonstrate how to address different causal questions (referred here as ""the total effect"" and ""the controlled direct effect"") with traditional analytic approaches under explicit assumptions. Our application focuses on smoking cessation in late-midlife. To illustrate core concepts, we discuss this example both in terms of a hypothetical randomized trial and with an emulation of such a trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study.",NA,medrxiv

However, this response to the pandemic promotes loneliness. Previous studies have reported an increase in loneliness since the outbreak of COVID-19, but there is little evidence on the relationship between job stress and loneliness among remote workers.

AimsTo assess the relationship between job stress and loneliness among remote workers.

MethodsThis study is a part of nation-wide cross-sectional online survey evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. A total of 27,036 full-time workers completed the self-administrated questionnaire in December 2020. We extracted data on 4,052 desk workers who indicated that they were doing remote work. Loneliness was assessed using a single question and job stress was measured using the Job Content Questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression was performed.

ResultsFrequency of remote work was moderately associated with loneliness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-2.46, P = 0.033). Participants who reported of having a low level of co-worker or supervisor support had greater odds of feeling lonely than those who were highly supported (co-worker support: AOR = 4.06, 95% CI: 2.82-5.84, P <0.001; supervisor support: AOR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.79-3.47, P <0.001).

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune function by discriminating self from non-self. In recent years there has been rapid advancement in ""Next Generation Sequencing"" technology. It enables the detection of HLA alleles in four or even six digits, providing a high level of precision. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic variants at HLA-A,-B,-C,-DQB1 and -DRB1 loci in OSA patients and unrelated healthy individuals by targeted NGS in the Turkish population.

Materials methodsFifty newly diagnosed patients with OSA and 50 control subjects were enrolled in the study. OSA diagnosis was made by utilizing the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)[&ge;]5 in overnight polysomnography (PSG). Blood samples were obtained in the morning, after PSG. Controls were randomly selected from healthy volunteers who had a low risk for OSA. Genotyping of HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 genes were performed by using next generation sequencing.

ResultsHLA-A*02:01, HLA-C*03:03:01, HLA-C*14:03, HLA DRB1*04:05 alleles were found more frequently in OSA patients, but not in the controls (p=0.036, p=0.007, p=0.043 and 0.013, respectively). The allele frequencies of HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-B*35:02 were significantly higher in controls compared to OSA patients (p=0.024 and p=0.043).

ConclusionThese results suggest that HLA-A*02:01, HLA-C*03:03:01, HLA-C*14:03, HLA DRB1*04:05 alleles may play a predisposing role in the Turkish population with OSA. In addition, HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-B*35:02 alleles may be protective in this population.",NA,medrxiv

Comparison of brain MRI features between cases and controls have highlighted potential causes of psychiatric and behavioral traits. However, due to the cost of collecting MRI data and the difficulty in recruiting particular patient groups, most studies have small sample sizes, limiting their reliability. Furthermore, interpretation is complicated by reverse causality, where many observed brain differences are the result of disease rather than the cause. Here we propose a method (BrainXcan) that leverages the power of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), reference brain MRI data, and methodological advances in causal inference using genetic instruments to discover new mechanisms of disease etiology and validate existing ones. BrainXcan tests complex traits for association with genetic predictors of brain MRI derived phenotypes to pinpoint relevant region-specific and cross-brain features. It also evaluates consistency and direction of the causal flow with Mendelian Randomization. As this approach requires only genetic data, BrainXcan allows us to test a host of hypotheses on mental illness, across many disorders and MRI modalities, using existing public data resources. Our method shows that reduced axonal density across the brain is associated with the risk of schizophrenia, consistent with the disconnectivity hypothesis. We also find structural features hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex among others associated with schizophrenia risk highlighting the potential of our approach to bring orthogonal lines of evidence to inform the biology of complex traits.",NA,medrxiv

Here, we examined if polygenic scores (PGS) of traits associated with anorexia nervosa are also associated with adolescent ED symptoms in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).

MethodsWe calculated PGS for 25 traits (16 psychiatric, 4 metabolic, and 5 anthropometric) and investigated their associations with eight ED symptoms, including behaviors such as fasting for weight loss and cognitions such as body dissatisfaction (n range=2,991-6,013).

ResultsHigher attention deficit hyperactivity disorder PGS and lower educational attainment PGS were associated with fasting for weight loss. Higher insomnia PGS was associated with increased body dissatisfaction. We found no evidence of an association between metabolic trait PGS and any ED symptom. Regarding anthropometrics, fat-free mass, fat mass, and body fat percentage PGSs, were positively associated with binge eating, excessive exercise, fasting for weight loss, body dissatisfaction, and weight and shape concern.

ConclusionsED symptoms are genetically associated with psychiatric and anthropometric, but not with metabolic traits. Our findings provide insights for future genetic research investigating why some individuals with ED symptoms progress to develop threshold EDs while others do not.",NA,medrxiv

Improvements in care and clinician confidence may shorten the time spent as an inpatient, or the need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high density unit (HDU), while novel treatment modalities may reduce the time course of illness. On the other hand, limited resources at times of high demand may lead to rationing of resources, with less beneficial consequences. Despite little evidence on how the values of such variables change over the course of a crisis (such as the current COVID-19 pandemic), they may nevertheless be used as proxies for disease severity, outcome measures for clinical trials, and to inform planning and logistics. We hypothesise that variation of this kind has been present over the first year of the pandemic.

Methods and FindingsWe investigate such time trends in an extremely large international cohort of 142,540 patients with symptom onset of, or hospital admission for, COVID-19 during 2020. The variables investigated are time from symptom onset to hospital admission, probability of ICU/HDU admission, time from hospital admission to ICU/HDU admission, case fatality ratio (CFR) and total length of hospital stay. Time from hospital symptom onset to hospital admission showed a rapid decline during the first months of the pandemic followed by peaks during August/September and December. ICU/HDU admission was more frequent from June to August, while there were only modest time trends in time from hospital admission to ICU/HDU. The CFR was lowest from June to August, a trend mostly driven by patients with no ICU/HDU admission. Raw numbers for overall hospital stay showed little overall variation over the time period, but further examination reveals a clear decline in time to discharge for ICU/HDU survivors. The main limitations are that these are predominantly severe COVID-19 cases, and that there are temporal, spatial and demographic biases present in an observational study of this kind.

ConclusionsOur results establish that variables of these kinds have limitations when used as outcome measures in a rapidly-evolving situation.",NA,medrxiv

Whilst the exact nature of effective immunity remains incompletely defined, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are a critical feature of the immune response that will likely form a key correlate of protection against COVID-19. Here, we developed and optimised a high-throughput whole blood-based assay to determine the T cell response associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination amongst 156 healthy donors and 67 cancer patients. Following overnight in vitro stimulation with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides, blood plasma samples were harvested and analysed for TH1-type effector cytokines (IFN-{gamma} and IL-2). Amongst healthy donors, highly significant differential IFN-{gamma}+/IL-2+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were seen amongst vaccinated or previously infected COVID-19-positive individuals in comparison to unknown/naive individuals (P < 0.0001). IL-2 production from T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 derived antigens was a highly predictive diagnostic assay (P < 0.0001; 96.0% sensitivity, 93.9% specificity); measurement of IFN-{gamma}+ SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses was equally effective at identifying asymptomatic (antibody and T cell positive) participants.

While there is growing literature on the effects of various variants-of-concern (VOC) on increased transmission, the extent to which VOCs may lead to more severe disease remains debated.

MethodsIn the current analysis, we use a population-based propensity-score matched cohort study of all incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with VOC testing in Ontario, Canada to estimate healthcare resource use and health outcomes attributable to VOCs introduced to Ontario between January 1 and April 9, 2021, relative to the previously circulating wild-type strain.

ResultsWe find that VOCs are associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.10-2.40) and ICU admission (OR, 3.31; 95%CI, 2.84-3.86); as well as with a higher odds of mortality for both the general COVID-19 population (OR 1.75; 1.47-2.09) and hospitalised cases (OR, 1.62; 95%CI, 1.23-2.15).

MethodsA cross-sectional, epidemiological study of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases, reported in the south region of the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, from March 2020 to February 2021. Data were obtained from the official reporting databases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health for influenza-like illness (ILI) (esus-VE, in Portuguese) and for patients hospitalized for SARS (SIVEP-Gripe). The space distribution of cases is described by 2D kernel density. To assess potential factors associated with the outcomes of interest, generalized linear and additive logistic models were adjusted. To evaluate the discriminatory power of each variable studied as well as the final model, C-statistic was used (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve). Moreover, a predictive model for risk of death was developed and validated with accuracy measurements in the development, internal and temporal (March and April 2021) validation samples.

ResultsA total of 16,061 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Morbidities associated with a higher risk of SARS were obesity (OR=25.32) and immunodepression (OR=12.15). Morbidities associated with a higher risk of death were renal disease (OR=11.8) and obesity (OR=8.49), and clinical and demographic data were more important than the territory per se.

The INDSCI-SIM model is a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured compartmental model for COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions, an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient across the country. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave. Our estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) are in the range 0.05 - 0.15, broadly consistent with previous estimates but substantially lower than values that have been estimated for other LMIC countries. We find that approximately 40% of India had been infected overall by the end of the first wave, results broadly consistent with those from serosurveys. These results contribute to the understanding of the long-term trajectory of COVID-19 in India.",NA,medrxiv

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcomes of 118 MCD patients receiving surgical treatment in the past 30 years and found patients receiving penetrating keratoplasty had the lowest recurrence rate 13.75%, compared with 40.91% patients receiving deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty and 25% receiving phototherapeutic keratectomy. Transcriptomic analysis in human corneal single-cell sequencing atlas found the MCD pathogenic gene CHST6 was abundant in corneal endothelium rather than other cell types. CHST6 protein showed a similar expression pattern to its mRNA. The mouse homologous gene Chst5 was 120-fold higher in corneal endothelium than in the epithelial and stromal layers. Mice with specifically Chst5 knockdown in the endothelial layer by microinjection of the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 - shRNA plasmids into the anterior chamber, rather than Chst5 knockdown into the stroma, showed MCD-like phenotypes. Corneal opacification and abnormally larger collagen fibrils were observed in the endothelial Chst5 knockdown mice. The same corneal characteristics were observed after overexpressing human CHST6 mutant R50H in the mouse endothelium. These observations indicating the pathogenesis of MCD is more related to the corneal endothelium rather than the stroma.

Significance StatementOur study gave evidence that corneal endothelium contributing more to the macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) development, rather than other cell types in the cornea. We proposed penetrating keratoplasty might serve as a more proper surgical treatment for MCD according to the recurrence rate analysis.

In a community sample of young adults (n=996, aged 18-30) assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated gendered patterns in NSSI etiology.

MethodsMediation and moderation analyses considered associations between past-year NSSI prevalence, gender, and putative mechanistic variables: self-reported psychological distress (K10), emotion dysregulation (DERS), and impulsivity (UPPS-P).

ResultsNearly twice as many women as men reported past-year NSSI (14.47% versus 7.78%). Women reported significantly higher psychological distress and significantly lower sensation seeking and positive urgency than men. Psychological distress partially statistically mediated the relationship between gender and past-year NSSI. Gender did not significantly moderate associations between self-reported distress, emotion dysregulation, or impulsivity and past-year NSSI. Past-year NSSI prevalence did not significantly decrease with age and we found no significant age by gender interaction.

ConclusionsGreater levels of NSSI in young women are explained by their greater levels of emotional distress. Women do not appear to be more likely than men to report NSSI due to differences in how they manage emotional distress: gender did not moderate the association between psychological distress and past-year NSSI, and there were no gender differences in emotion dysregulation or negative urgency. Furthermore, we show that NSSI remains prevalent beyond adolescence. Early interventions which reduce distress or improve distress tolerance, strengthen emotion regulation skills, and provide alternative coping strategies merit investigation for NSSI.

In severely resource-constrained situations, limited cycles of disinfection and extended use of gloves is recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conserve supplies. However, these guidelines are based on limited evidence.

MethodsSerial cycles of hand hygiene were performed on gloved hands using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) (six and ten cycles), 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution (ten cycles), or soap and water (ten cycles) on three types of latex and three types of nitrile medical exam gloves, purchased in the United States and India. A modified FDA-approved water-leak test was performed to evaluate glove integrity after repeated applications of these disinfecting agents. 80 gloves per disinfectant-glove type combination were tested. Within each glove type the proportion of gloves that failed the water-leak test for each disinfectant was compared to that of the control using a non-inferiority design with a non-inferiority margin of five percentage points. Results were also aggregated by glove material, and combined for overall results.

FindingsWhen aggregated by glove material, the dilute bleach exposure demonstrated the lowest difference in proportion failed between treatment and control arms: -2.5 percentage points (95% CI: -5.3 to 0.3) for nitrile, 0.6 percentage points (95% CI: -2.6 to 3.8) for non-powdered latex. For US-purchased gloves tested with six and ten applications of ABHR, the mean difference in failure risk between treatment and control gloves was within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of five percentage points or less, though some findings were inconclusive because confidence intervals extended beyond the non-inferiority margin. The aggregated difference in failure risk between treatment and control gloves was 3.5 percentage points (0.6 to 6.4) for soap and water, and 2.3 percentage points (-0.5 to 5.0) and 5.0 percentage points (1.8 to 8.2) for 10 and 6 applications of ABHR, respectively.

However, detection of ctDNA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has continued to prove challenging. We performed retrospective analysis to quantify ctDNA levels in a cohort of 100 patients with early-stage NSCLC prior to treatment with curative intent enrolled in the LUCID study (NCT04153526). Where tumour tissue was available for whole exome sequencing, mutations identified were used to define patient-specific sequencing assays. For those 90 patients, plasma cell-free DNA was sequenced to high depth across capture panels targeting a median of 328 mutations specific to each patient. Data was analysed using Integration of Variant Reads (INVAR), detecting ctDNA in 66.7% of patients, including 52.7% (29 of 55) patients with stage I disease and >88% detection for patients with stage II and III disease (16/18 and 15/17). ctDNA was detected in plasma at fractional concentrations as low as 9.1x10-6, and in patients with tumour volumes as low as 0.23 cm3. A 36-gene sequencing panel (InVisionFirst-Lung) was used to analyse plasma DNA in 27 samples including the 10 cases without tumour exome data, and detected ctDNA in 59% of samples tested (16 of 27). Across the entire cohort, detection rates were higher in squamous cell carcinoma patients compared to adenocarcinoma patients (81% vs. 59%). Detection of ctDNA prior to treatment was associated with significantly shorter time free from relapse, across all patients and in patient subgroups, with Hazard Ratios >11 for selected patient subsets. Our analysis indicates that for patients with stage I NSCLC, the median ctDNA fraction in plasma is approx. 12 parts per million (0.0012%).

No drug for prevention or treatment in earlier stages of COVID-19 are yet found; although several new candidates including ivermectin, dutasteride, baricitinib, budesonide and colchicine are being studied with some early promising results. Safe and effective treatments will need to be both affordable and widely available globally.

ObjectivesThis analysis will estimate and compare potential generic production costs of a selection of COVID-19 drug candidates with international list prices.

MethodsCosts of production for new and potential COVID-19 drugs (dexamethasone, ivermectin, dutasteride, budesonide, baricitinib, tocilizumab, sarilumab and colchicine) were estimated using active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) data extracted from global shipping records. This was compared with national pricing data from low, medium, and high-income countries. Annual API export volumes from India were used to estimate the current availability of each drug.

ResultsRepurposed therapies can be generically manufactured at very low per-course costs: ranging from $2.58 for IV dexamethasone (or $0.19 orally) to $0.12 for ivermectin. No export price data was available for baricitinib, tocilizumab or sarilumab. When compared against international list prices, we found wide variations between countries. Drug API availability was generally good, with colchicine being the most available with sufficient annual API exported for 59.8 million treatment courses.

As COVID-19 infections and deaths increase in the pediatric population, characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in children would enable data-driven public health guidance.

MethodsNasal swabs collected from children with COVID-19 were analyzed. Viral load was quantified by RT-PCR; viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers. Correlations with age or symptom duration were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome amplification was compared with contemporaneous Massachusetts sequences to assess for clustering patterns.

ResultsNinety-seven children with COVID-19 (median age 10 years, range 2 weeks-22 years) were included in this study. Age did not impact SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasal secretions: children of all ages were equally likely to carry live, replicating virus. Children within the first five days of illness had higher viral loads and rates of culture positivity, and viral load in hospitalized children (n=30) did not differ from hospitalized adults (n=21) with similar duration of symptoms. While pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sequences were representative of those in the community, novel variants were identified.

ConclusionsChildren can carry high quantities of live, replicating virus, creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants. As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations, a clear understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.

Key points- Infants, children and adolescents are equally capable of carrying live, replicating SARS-CoV-2 in their nasal secretions.
- Respiratory secretions of infants, children and adolescents with COVID-19 are most infectious before symptoms develop and during the first five days of illness.
- Children can harbor SARS-CoV-2 variants that could have implications for disease severity and vaccine efficacy.",NA,medrxiv

However, this intervention has prompted widespread insecticide resistance (IR) and been associated with changes in mosquito behaviour that reduce their contact with LLINs. The relative importance and rate at which IR and behavioural adaptations emerge are poorly understood. We conducted surveillance of mosquito behaviour and IR at 12 sites in Burkina Faso to assess the magnitude and temporal dynamics of insecticide and behavioural resistance in vectors in the 2-year following mass LLIN distribution. Insecticide resistance was present in all vector populations and increased rapidly over the study. In contrast, no longitudinal shifts in LLIN-avoidance behaviours (earlier or outdoor biting and resting) were detected. There was a moderate shift in vector species composition from Anopheles coluzzii to Anopheles gambiae which coincided with a reduction in the proportion of bites preventable by LLINs; possibly driven by between-species variation in behaviour. These findings indicate that adaptations based on insecticide resistance arise and intensify more rapidly than behavioural shifts within mosquito vectors. However, longitudinal shifts in mosquito vector species composition were evident within 2 years following a mass LLIN distribution. This ecological shift was characterized by a relative increase in the moderately more exophagic species (An. gambiae) and coincided with a predicted decline in the degree of protection expected from LLINs. Although human exposure fell through the study period due to reducing vector densities and infection rates, such ecological shifts in vector species along with insecticide resistance were likely to have eroded the efficacy of LLINs. While both adaptations impact malaria control, the rapid increase of the former indicates it is the most rapid strategy but interventions targeting both will be needed.",NA,medrxiv

The simulations development is a case study demonstrating an approach for non-technical investigators to easily develop useful simulations of complex public health problems. We focused on malaria transmission, a major global public health problem, and insecticide resistance (IR), a major problem affecting malaria control. Insecticides are used to reduce transmission of malaria caused by the Plasmodium parasite that is spread by the Anopheles mosquito. However, the emergence and spread of IR in a mosquito population can diminish the insecticides effectiveness. IR results from mutations that produce behavioral changes or biochemical changes (such as detoxification enhancement, target site alterations) in the mosquito population that provide resistance to the insecticide. Evolutionary selection for the IR traits reduces the effectiveness of an insecticide favoring the resistant mosquito population. It has been suggested that biopesticides, and specifically those that are Late Life Acting (LLA), could address this problem. LLA insecticides exploit Plasmodiums approximate 10-day extrinsic incubation period in the mosquito vector, a delay that limits malaria transmission to older infected mosquitoes. Since the proposed LLA insecticide delays mosquito death until after the exposed mosquito has a chance to produce several broods of offspring, reducing the selective pressure for resistance, it delays IR and gives the insecticide longer effectivity. Such insecticides are designed to slow the evolution of IR thus maintaining their effectiveness for malaria control. For the IR problem, the simulation shows that an LLA insecticide could work as intended, but its operational characteristics are critical, primarily the mean-time-to-death after exposure and the associated standard deviation. We also demonstrate the simulations extensibility to other malaria control measures, including larval source control and policies to mitigate the spread of IR. The simulation was developed using NetLogo as a case study of a simple but useful approach to public health research.",NA,medrxiv

As The George Washington University (GWU), a large urban university, prepared to reopen for the Fall 2020 semester, GWU established protocols to protect the health and wellness of all members of campus community. Reopening efforts included a cadre of COVID-19 surveillance systems including development of a public health COVID-19 laboratory, weekly and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing and daily risk screening and symptom monitoring. Other activities included completion of a mandatory COVID-19 training and influenza vaccination for the on-campus population, quarantining of students returning to campus, campus-focused case investigations and quarantining of suspected close contacts, clinical follow-up of infected persons, and regular communication and monitoring. A smaller on-campus population of 4,435 students, faculty and staff returned to campus with later expansion of testing to accommodate GWU students living in the surrounding area. Between August 17 and December 4, 2020, 38,288 tests were performed; 220 were positive. The surveillance program demonstrated a relatively low positivity rate, with temporal clustering of infected persons mirroring community spread, and little evidence for transmission among the GWU on-campus population. These efforts demonstrate the feasibility of safely partially reopening a large urban college campus by applying core principles of public health surveillance, infectious disease epidemiology, behavioral measures, and increased testing capacity, while continuing to promote educational and research opportunities. GWU will continue to monitor the program as the pandemic evolves and periodically reassess to determine if these strategies will be successful upon a full return to in-person learning.

Summary BoxO_LIWhat is the current understanding of this subject? When the COVID-19 pandemic began, generally universities were not prepared and it was unclear how to safely reopen colleges and universities given the uncertain risks of transmission among students, faculty and staff.
C_LIO_LIWhat does this report add to the literature?

In this study, we investigate progress made in all phase therapeutic clinical trials for neuro-epithelial CNS tumors stratified by demographic-specific age-adjusted disease incidence and mortality. Additionally, we identify workforce characteristics associated with clinical trials meeting established accrual benchmarks.

METHODSRegistry study of published clinical trials for World Health Organization defined neuro-epithelial CNS tumors between January 2000 and December 2019. Study participants were obtained from PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. Population-based data originated from the CBTRUS for incidence analyses. SEER-18 Incidence-Based Mortality data was used for mortality analysis. Descriptive statistics, Fisher exact, and {chi}2 tests were used for data analysis.

RESULTSAmong 662 published clinical trials representing 49,907 participants, 62.5% of study participants were men and 37.5% were women (P<0.0001) representing a mortality specific over-accrual for men (P=0.001). Whites, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics represented 91.7%, 1.5%, 2.6%, and 1.7% of trial participants. Compared with mortality, Blacks (47% of expected mortality, P=0.008), Hispanics (17% of expected mortality, P<0.001) and Asians (33% of expected mortality, P<.001) were underrepresented compared with Whites (114% of expected mortality, P<0.001). Clinical trials meeting accrual benchmarks for race included minority authorship.

CONCLUSIONSFollowing the Revitalization Act, minorities and women remain underrepresented when compared with their demographic-specific incidence and mortality in therapeutic clinical trials for neuroepithelial tumors. This study provides a framework for clinical trial accrual efforts and offers guidance regarding workforce considerations associated with enrollment of vulnerable patients.

Key PointsMinorities and women with brain tumor diagnosis remain significantly under-accrued for neuro-oncology clinical trials compared to Caucasians and men based on proportional disease burden and demographic-specific mortality.

Importance of the StudyThe current state of clinical trial accrual in the U.S. for adult patients with gliomas across different demographic groups has not been comprehensively studied. This study aims to quantify clinical trial accrual by age-adjusted disease incidence and mortality for gender and race during a 20-year period following the NIH Revitalization Act, and to identify workforce characteristics associated with clinical trials meeting established race and gender accrual benchmarks. Minorities and women with brain tumor diagnosis remain significantly under-accrued for neuro-oncology clinical trials compared to Caucasians and men based on proportional disease burden and demographic-specific mortality. Despite the enactment of the NIH Revitalization Act to improve the representation of women and minorities in clinical trials nearly 30 years ago, this goal remains unmet in the field of neuro-oncology. Significant work is required to continue to implement and improve interventions to increase accrual of diverse patient populations.",NA,medrxiv

To further investigate the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 827 proband-parent trios and confirmed an overall significant enrichment of damaging de novo variants, especially in constrained genes. We identified LONP1 (Lon Peptidase 1, Mitochondrial) and ALYREF (Aly/REF Export Factor) as novel candidate CDH genes based on de novo variants at a false discovery rate below 0.05. We also performed ultra-rare variant association analyses in 748 cases and 11,220 ancestry-matched population controls and identified LONP1 as a risk gene contributing to CDH through both de novo and ultra-rare inherited largely heterozygous variants clustered in the core of the domains and segregating with CDH in familial cases. Approximately 3% of our CDH cohort was heterozygous with ultra-rare predicted damaging variants in LONP1 who have a range of clinical phenotypes including other anomalies in some individuals and higher mortality and requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mice with lung epithelium specific deletion of Lonp1 die immediately after birth and have reduced lung growth and branching that may at least partially explain the high mortality in humans.

MethodsWe surveyed exome sequencing data from a large clinical care cohort for deleterious variation in the MECP2 gene. We reviewed de-identified clinical information for these individuals to interrogate for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

ResultsWe identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in MECP2 in individuals with typical and atypical Rett syndrome, and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, and estimate a prevalence of MECP2- associated disorders of 1 in 2,645 individuals. We observed a 7.45x increased relative risk of neuropsychiatric phenotypes, especially major depression, in adult individuals with deleterious variants in MECP2 without a diagnosis of Rett syndrome. Male individuals with missense pathogenic variants in MECP2 appear to have more severe neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

ConclusionsWe identified and report individuals with heterozygous pathogenic variants in MECP2 and their phenotypes in a large clinical cohort. The observed prevalence of MECP2-associated disorders in our cohort is higher than estimated in the literature. Individuals with pathogenic variants in MECP2 can survive into adulthood but are at increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly major depression.

However, direct evidence of autoimmunity, infections, or a proinflammatory state is often lacking, and there is no unifying pathogenic pathway. This could be due to underlying genetic heterogeneity, which could lead to the development of PANS through different cellular and molecular pathways. Unfortunately, little is known about the genetic basis of PANS. Consequently, we carried out whole exome sequencing (WES) on a U.S. cohort of 386 cases who met diagnostic criteria for PANS, including 133 family triads, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on ten cases from the European Union, who were selected for WGS because of severe PANS symptoms. We focused on identifying potentially deleterious genetic variants that were either de novo or ultra-rare with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.001. Candidate mutations were found in 11 genes: PPM1D, SGCE, PLCG2, NLRC4, CACNA1B, SHANK3, CHK2, GRIN2A, RAG1, GABRG2, and SYNGAP1 in a total of 20 cases, which included two sets of siblings, and two or more unrelated subjects with ultra-rare variants in SGCE, NLRC4, RAG1, and SHANK3. The PANS candidate genes we identified separate into two broad functional categories. One group regulates peripheral innate and adaptive immune responses (e.g., PPM1D, CHK2, NLRC4, RAG1, PLCG2), some of which also influence microglia function. Another is expressed primarily at neuronal synapses or directly modulates synaptic function (SHANK3, SYNGAP1, GRIN2A, GABRG2, CACNA1B, SGCE). These neuronal PANS candidate genes are often mutated in autism spectrum disorder, developmental disorders, and myoclonus-dystonia. In fact, eight out of 20 cases in this study developed PANS superimposed on a preexisting neurodevelopmental disorder. There is, however, clinical overlap between these two groups and some crossover expression (e.g., some neuronal genes are expressed in immune cells and vice versa) that diminishes the neuronal/immune dichotomy. Genes in both categories are also highly expressed in the enteric nervous system, and in the choroid plexus and brain vasculature, suggesting they might contribute to a breach in the blood-CSF barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) that would permit the entry of autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and autoantibodies into the brain. Thus, PANS is a genetically heterogeneous condition that can occur as a stand-alone neuropsychiatric condition or co-morbid with neurodevelopmental disorders, with candidate genes functioning at several levels of the neuroinflammatory axis.",NA,medrxiv

Allied to this is the potential for long perm persistent infections within immune compromised individuals to allow a broader range of viral evolution in the face of sub-optimal immune driven selective pressure. Here we report on an immunocompromised individual who is hypogammaglobulinaemic and was persistently infected with SARS-CoV-2 for over 290 days, the longest persistent infection recorded in the literature to date. During this time, nine samples of viral nucleic acid were obtained and analysed by next-generation sequencing. Initially only a single mutation (L179I) was detected in the spike protein relative to the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, with no further changes identified at day 58. However, by day 155 the spike protein had acquired a further four amino acid changes, namely S255F, S477N, H655Y and D1620A and a two amino acid deletion ({Delta}H69/{Delta}V70). Infectious virus was cultured from a nasopharyngeal sample taken on day 155 and next-generation sequencing confirmed that the mutations in the virus mirrored those identified by sequencing of the corresponding swab sample. The isolated virus was susceptible to remdesivir in vitro, however a 17-day course of remdesivir started on day 213 had no effect on the viral RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value.

The {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 deletion in the N-terminus of the spike protein which arose in our patient is also present in the B.1.1.7 variant of concern and has been associated with viral escape mutagenesis after treatment of another immunocompromised patient with convalescent plasma.

The newest of these is a triple therapy of Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI, Trikafta(R)). Little is known about how these drugs will affect polymicrobial lung infections, which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people with CF (pwCF).

Methodswe analyzed the sputum microbiome and metabolome from pwCF (n=24) before and after ETI therapy using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.

ResultsThe lung microbiome diversity, particularly its evenness, was increased (p = 0.044) and the microbiome profiles were different between individuals before and after therapy (PERMANOVA F=1.92, p=0.044). Despite these changes, the microbiomes were more similar within an individual than across the sampled population. There were no specific microbial taxa that were different in abundance before and after therapy, but collectively, the log-ratio of anaerobes to classic CF pathogens significantly decreased. The sputum metabolome also showed changes due to ETI. Beta-diversity increased after therapy (PERMANOVA F=4.22, p=0.022) and was characterized by greater variation across subjects while on treatment. This significant difference in the metabolome was driven by a decrease in peptides, amino acids, and metabolites from the kynurenine pathway. Metabolism of the three small molecules that make up ETI was extensive, including previously uncharacterized structural modifications.

ConclusionsThis study shows that ETI therapy affects both the microbiome and metabolome of airway mucus. This effect was stronger on sputum biochemistry, which may reflect changing niche spaces for microbial residency in lung mucus as the drugs effects take hold, which then leads to changing microbiology.

In the present study, we analyzed a large cohort of individuals with GABRB3 variants to deepen the phenotypic understanding and investigate genotype-phenotype correlations.

MethodsThrough an international collaboration, we analyzed electro-clinical data of unpublished individuals with variants in GABRB3 and we reviewed previously published cases. All missense variants were mapped onto the 3D structure of the GABRB3 subunit and clinical phenotypes associated with the different key structural domains were investigated.

ResultsWe characterize 71 individuals with GABRB3 variants, including 22 novel subjects, expressing a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Interestingly, phenotypes correlated with structural locations of the variants. Generalized epilepsy, with a median age at onset of 10.5 months, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability were associated with variants in the extracellular domain. Focal epilepsy with early onset (median: 2.75 months of age) and severe intellectual disability were associated with variants in the pore-lining helical transmembrane domain.

ConclusionThese genotype/phenotype correlations will aid the genetic counseling and treatment of individuals affected by GABRB3-related disorders. Future studies may reveal whether functional differences underlie the phenotypic differences.

To identify the CAP-associated genetic risk loci, we performed a meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed CAP (3,310 individuals) with 2,655 healthy controls. The findings revealed CYP1A1 variants (rs2606345, rs4646903, rs1048943) associated with pneumonia. We observed rs2606345 [G vs T; OR=1.49(1.29-1.69); p=0.0001; I2= 15.5%], and rs1048943 [T vs G; OR= 1.31(0.90-1.71); p=0.002; I2=19.3%] as risk markers and rs4646903 [T vs C; OR= 0.79(0.62-0.96); p=0.03; I2=0%] as a protective marker for susceptibility to CAP, when compared with healthy controls. Our meta-analysis showed the presence of CYP1A1 SNP alleles contributing significant risk toward pneumonia susceptibility. Interestingly, we observed a striking difference of allele frequency for rs2606345 (CYP1A1) among Europeans, Africans and Asians which may provide a possible link for observed variations in death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral pneumonia. We report, for the first time, a significant positive correlation for the risk allele (T or A) of rs2606345, with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate worldwide and within a genetically heterogeneous nation like India. Mechanistically, the risk allele  A (rs2606345) is associated with lower expression of CYP1A1 and presumably leads to reduced capacity for xenobiotic detoxification. We note that ambient air pollution, a powerful inducer of CYP1A1 gene expression, is globally associated with lower, not higher mortality, as would normally be predicted. In conclusion, we find that CYP1A1 alleles are associated with CAP mortality, presumably via altered xenobiotic metabolism. We speculate that gene-environment interactions governing CYP1A1 expression may influence COVID-19 mortality.",NA,medrxiv

Severe cases of COVID-19 could lead to hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission. However, little is known about the symptomatic experience of outpatients with COVID-19, or its daily life impact; the objective of this qualitative research was to document this experience.

MethodsThirty US adult patients with COVID-19 were interviewed within 21 days of diagnosis. To be included, patients had to self-report one of the following: fever, cough, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, change/loss of taste/smell, vomiting/diarrhoea or body/muscle aches. Patients were asked open-ended questions to elicit their symptoms and the impacts COVID-19 had on their daily lives. Interviews were transcribed and inductively coded to perform thematic analysis and propose a conceptual model. The adequacy of the sample size was assessed by conceptual saturation analysis. Five independent clinicians were also interviewed about their experience treating outpatients with COVID-19.

FindingsPatient-reported concepts were organised into six symptom themes (upper respiratory, lower respiratory, systemic, gastrointestinal, smell and taste, and other) and seven impact themes (activities of daily living, broad daily activities, leisure/social activities, physical impacts, emotional impacts, professional impacts and quarantine-specific impacts). Symptom type, severity, duration and time of onset varied greatly by patient. Clinicians endorsed all symptoms reported by patients.

InterpretationThe manifestation of symptoms in outpatient COVID-19 is heterogeneous and affects all aspects of daily life. While reported symptoms were in line with previously published reports, patients offered new detailed insights into their symptomatic experiences and the impacts that symptoms had on their daily lives. Future studies should explore the symptoms and impacts of COVID-19 longitudinally, to better understand their early onset, their progression/resolution and the possible long-term implications of COVID-19.

Evidence supporting CP for treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been inconclusive, leading to conflicting recommendations regarding its use. The primary objective was to perform a comparative effectiveness study of CP for all-cause, in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsThe matched, multicenter, electronic health records-based, retrospective cohort study included 44,770 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in one of 176 HCA Healthcare-affiliated community hospitals across the United States from March 2 to October 7, 2020. Coarsened exact matching (1:k) was employed resulting in a sample of 3,774 CP and 10,687 comparison patients.

ResultsExamining mortality using a shared frailty model and controlling for concomitant medications, calendar date of admission, and days from admission to transfusion demonstrated a significant association of CP with lower risk of mortality compared to the comparison group (aHR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86, p<0.001). Examination of patient risk trajectories, represented by 400 clinico-demographic features from our Real-Time Risk Model (RTRM), indicated that patients who received CP recovered more quickly. The time from admission to CP transfusion was significantly associated with risk of mortality and stratification revealed that CP within 3 days after admission, but not 4-7 days, was associated with a significant reduction in mortality risk (aHR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.47-0.60, p<0.001). CP serology level was inversely associated with mortality when controlling for interaction with days to transfusion (HR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.997-0.999, p = 0.013) but was not significant in a univariable analysis.

ConclusionUtilizing this large, diverse, multicenter cohort, we demonstrate that CP is significantly associated with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality. These observations demonstrate the utility of real-world evidence and suggest the need for further evaluation prior to abandoning CP as a viable therapy for COVID-19.

Research in Context

Evidence before this studyDiscrepant reports of the efficacy of various treatments for COVID-19, including convalescent plasma (CP), emerged from a rapidly evolving political and interventional landscape of the pandemic. Furthermore, clinical interpretations of this discordant data led to underuse, overuse and misuse of certain interventions, often ignoring mechanistic context altogether. CP has been utilized in prior pandemics/epidemics to introduce antibodies to elicit an immune response during the viral phase of infection. Thus, CP received early priority for emergency use and randomized trial engagement. Initially, the United States had issued individual emergency investigational new drug (eIND) use for CP and initiated its expanded access protocol (EAP) to monitor its safety profile and to allow broader access. This effectively restricted access to those with severe disease, which is not mechanistically aligned with targeting the viral phase. Many randomized control trials (RCTs) were being setup for testing efficacy of CP in the inpatient setting and, to a lesser extent, the outpatient setting. Some trial designs focused on severe disease and others on less severe. United States RCTs had additional enrollment challenges due to competing patient access to EAP. All studies were limited by supply and demand due to regional outbreaks and to the shear operational effort of coordinating donations, sampling, serology testing, ordering, and distribution.

To date, most matched studies and RCTs around the globe have shown a trend of CP providing survival benefit, but all had relatively small cohorts except the RECOVERY trial, which failed to show a benefit with CP. Results ranged from no significant effect to 56% reduction in mortality with the latter coming out of a multisite RCT based in New York and Rio De Janeiro. There has been a minimum of nine matched control studies and seven randomized control trials evaluating convalescent plasma.

We frequently assessed World Health Organization (WHO), United Stated Food and Drug Administration (FDA), BARDA/Mayo Clinic led EAP, and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) resources as well as queried both preprint archives (MedRXIV & SSRN) and PubMed with the search terms ""retrospective"", ""convalescent plasma"", ""randomized"", ""trial"", ""comparative effect"", ""COVID"", ""hospital"", ""in-hospital"", ""hospitalized"" and ""mortality"" to ensure we were considering the most recent methodology and results generated for CP. The last search was performed on May 14, 2021. No date restrictions or language filters were applied.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this study is the largest and most geographically diverse of its kind to comprehensively evaluate and confirm the beneficial association of CP with all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our data provides context to optimal delivery and validates recent trends in the literature showing CP benefit. There is a dose-response effect with CP antibody levels and we demonstrate that sooner really is better in accordance with the mechanisms of viral clearance and immune regulation. Finally, this is all done in the context of a diverse community setting in one of the largest hospital systems in the United States.

Implications of all the available evidenceAs novel, more virulent and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge around the globe and as reports of post-vaccine ""breakthrough"" infections and vaccine hesitancy increase, there is a renewed motivation to identify effective treatments for hospitalized patients. The data presented here, along with a growing body of evidence from matched-control studies and RCTs, demonstrate that further evaluation is required prior to abandoning CP as an effective intervention in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",NA,medrxiv

We evaluated the relationship between patient sex and serum TNF antagonist drug and antibody concentrations in inflammatory bowel disease.

MethodsA nationwide multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted by evaluating patient charts from July 2018 until February 2021. The effect of patient sex on anti-drug antibodies and serum drug concentration in patients with IBD across 7 hospitals was investigated. A subgroup analysis also investigated the effect of anti-TNF combination therapy.

ResultsIn the total study sample (n = 1093), males receiving infliximab had higher anti-drug antibody concentrations (38.3 vs. 22.3 AU/ml; aRoGM = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.30-2.27, p-value <0.001) compared to females. Additionally, infliximab serum drug concentrations among males were lower compared to females (2.6 vs. 4.1 ug/ml; aRoGM = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44-0.88, p-value = 0.007). In the subgroup analysis (n = 359), male compared to female patients on combination therapy with infliximab and immunomodulators had similar anti-drug antibody concentrations (30.2 vs. 21.9 AU/ml; aRoGM = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.79-2.40, p-value = 0.254).. There was no difference in the anti-drug antibody and serum drug concentrations among males and females on adalimumab.

ConclusionIn patients receiving infliximab, anti-drug antibodies were higher in males than females. Consistent with this, serum drug concentrations were lower in males than females on infliximab. However, there was no difference in anti-drug antibody and serum drug concentrations among males and females on adalimumab. In addition, no difference in anti-drug antibodies between males and females receiving anti-TNF combination therapy was observed.

The placenta senses and adapts to the pregnancy environment in an effort to support optimal fetal development. However, the mechanisms driving these adaptations, and the resulting placental phenotypes, are poorly understood. We hypothesised that maternal underweight and obesity would be associated with increased prevalence of placental pathologies in term and preterm pregnancies.

MethodsData from 12,154 pregnancies were obtained from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a prospective cohort study conducted from 1959 to 1974. Macro and microscopic placental pathologies were analysed across maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) to assess differences in the presence of pathologies among underweight, overweight, and obese BMI groups compared to normal weight reference BMI at term and preterm. Placental pathologies were also assessed across fetal sex.

ResultsPregnancies complicated by obesity had placentae with increased fetal inflammation at preterm and increased maternal inflammation at term. In term pregnancies, increasing maternal BMI associated with increased maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), odds of an appropriate mature placenta for gestational age, and placental weight, and decreased placental efficiency. Male placentae, independent of maternal BMI, had increased inflammation, MVM, and placental efficiency than female placentae, particularly at term.

DiscussionMaternal underweight and obesity are not inert conditions for the placenta, and the histomorphological changes driven by suboptimal maternal BMI may serve as indicators of adversities experienced in utero and potential predictors of future health trajectories.",NA,medrxiv

Algorithmic approaches for suicide risk detection have been developed in recent years, mostly based on data from electronics health records (EHRs). These models typically do not optimally exploit the valuable temporal information inherent in these longitudinal data.

MethodsWe propose a temporally enhanced variant of the Random Forest model - Omni-Temporal Balanced Random Forests (OTBRFs) - that incorporates temporal information in every tree within the forest. We develop and validate this model using longitudinal EHRs and clinician notes from the Mass General Brigham Health System recorded between 1998 and 2018, and compare its performance to a baseline Naive Bayes Classifier and two standard versions of Balanced Random Forests.

ResultsTemporal variables were found to be associated with suicide risk. RF models were more accurate than Naive Bayesian classifiers at predicting suicide risk in advance (AUC=0.824 vs. 0.754 respectively). The OT-BRF model performed best among all RF approaches (0.339 sensitivity at 95% specificity), compared to 0.290 and 0.286 for the other two RF models. Temporal variables were assigned high importance by the models that incorporated them.

DiscussionWe demonstrate that temporal variables have an important role to play in suicide risk detection, and that requiring their inclusion in all random forest trees leads to increased predictive performance. Integrating temporal information into risk prediction models helps the models interpret patient data in temporal context, improving predictive performance.",NA,medrxiv

Detailed study of human immune response to SARS-COVIS-2 infection is the important topic for a successful treatment of this disease. Our study was aimed to characterize immune response on the level of antibody profiling in convalescent plasma of patients in Georgia. Antibodies against the following SARS-COV-2 proteins were studied: nucleocapsid and various regions of Spike (S) protein: S1, S2 and Receptor binding domain (RBD). Convalescent plasma of patients 6-8 weeks after initial confirmation of SARS-COV-2 infection were tested. Nearly 80% out of 154 patients studied showed presence of antibodies against nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to three fragments of S protein was significantly less and varied in the range of 20-30%. Significantly more females as compared to males were producing antibodies against S1 fragment, whereas the difference between genders by the antibodies against nucleocapsid protein and RBD was statistically significant only by one-tailed Fisher exact test. There were no differences between the males and females by antibodies against S2 fragment. Thus, immune response against some viral antigens are stronger in females and we suggest that it could be one of the factors of less female fatality after SARS-COVID-2 infection.",NA,medrxiv

This study aims to compare the clinical profile of the first wave (April-June 2020) and the second wave (March-May 2021) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a single tertiary care center of India. This will help prioritize the target population group and management strategies in the upcoming third wave if any.

MethodsIn this retrospective observational study, we examined the demographic profile, symptoms at presentation, the severity of illness, baseline investigations, treatments received, underlying comorbidities, and outcomes of the COVID-19 patients belonging to the first (W1) and the second wave (W2) of the pandemic in India.

FindingsAmong 106 patients in W1 and 104 patients in W2, the age group affected most was 37{middle dot}1 (SD=16{middle dot}9) years compared with 50.5 (SD=17.7) years respectively. The baseline oxygen saturation is lower in W2, being 84{middle dot}0 (13{middle dot}4) % compared with 91{middle dot}9 (7{middle dot}4) % in W1. 70.2 % of the cases belonged to the severe category in W2 compared to 37.5% in W1. W2 patients demonstrated higher transaminase levels [SGOT, 108.3 (99.3) v/s 54.6 (69.3); SGPT, 97.6 (82.3) v/s 58.7 (69.7)] with respect to W1. Similarly, the CT severity score for W2 [29.5 (6.7)] was higher than W1 [23{middle dot}2 (11{middle dot}5)][All P<0.05]. The proportion of patients requiring oxygen (81.8% v/s 11.2%), high flow nasal cannula (11.4% v/s 5.6%), non-invasive ventilation (41.2% v/s 1.5%), invasive ventilation (24.5% v/s 0.9%), as well as ICU/HDU admissions (56.4% v/s 12.0%) was higher for W2 as compared with W1. The measured case fatality rate varies from 29% for W2 to 9.6% for W1.

InterpretationHigher age, oxygen requirement, ventilator requirement, ICU admission, and organ impairment are more prevalent in the admitted COVID-19 cases during the second wave that has hit India compared to the first wave and associated with more fatalities.

It is currently unknown whether existing trauma systems improve the outcomes of these patients. This systematic review investigates the association between higher-level trauma center care and outcomes of adult patients who were admitted to hospital due to injuries sustained following low-energy trauma.

MethodsA pre-registered systematic review (CRD42020211652) of subject databases and grey literature, supplemented by targeted manual searching, was conducted in January 2021. Studies were eligible if they reported outcomes in adults admitted to hospital due to low-energy trauma. Studies were excluded if participants were not adults or were not admitted to hospital. Studies in lower- and middle-income settings were excluded due to differences in demographics and healthcare systems. Risk of bias was assessed by independent reviewers using the Robins-I tool. In the presence of study heterogeneity a narrative synthesis was pre-specified.

ResultsThree observational studies were included from 2,898 unique records. The studies risk of bias was moderate-to-serious due to potential residual confounding and selection bias. All studies compared outcomes among adults injured by ground-level falls treated in trauma centers verified by the American College of Surgeons in the USA. The studies reported divergent results. One demonstrated improved outcomes in level 3 or 4 trauma centers (Observed: Expected Mortality 0.973, 95%CI 0.971-0.975), one demonstrated improved outcomes in level 1 trauma centers (Adjusted Odds Ratio 0.71, 95%CI 0.56-0.91), and one demonstrated no difference between level 1 or 2 and level 3 or 4 trauma center care (Adjusted Odds Ratio 0.91 (0.80-1.04).

ConclusionsThere is currently no strong evidence for the efficacy of major trauma centers in caring for adult patients injured by a ground-level fall. Further studies at lower risk of bias and studies conducted outwith the USA are required.

While some commercial electronic air cleaners could be effective in reducing primary pollutants and inactivating bioaerosol, studies on the formation of secondary products from oxidation chemistry during their use are limited. Here, we measured oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and the chemical composition of particles generated from a hydroxyl radical generator in an office. During operation, enhancements in OVOCs, especially low-molecular-weight organic and inorganic acids, were detected. Rapid increases in particle number and volume concentrations were observed, corresponding to the formation of highly-oxidized secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (O:C [~]1.3). The organic mass spectra showed an enhanced signal at m/z 44 (CO2+) and the aerosol evolved with a slope of [~] -1 in the Van Krevelen diagram. These results suggest that organic acids generated during VOC oxidation contributed to particle nucleation and SOA formation. Nitrate, sulfate, and chloride also increased during the oxidation without a corresponding increase in ammonium, suggesting organic nitrate, organic sulfate, and organic chloride formation. As secondary species are reported to have detrimental health effects, further studies are needed to evaluate potential OVOCs and SOA formation from electronic air cleaners in different indoor environments.

Utilizing a large set of local and international CXR images, we developed an AI model with high performance on temporal and external validation.

ObjectiveInvestigate real-time performance of an AI-enabled COVID-19 diagnostic support system across a 12-hospital system.

DesignProspective observational study.

SettingLabeled frontal CXR images (samples of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) from the M Health Fairview (Minnesota, USA), Valencian Region Medical ImageBank (Spain), MIMIC-CXR, Open-I 2013 Chest X-ray Collection, GitHub COVID-19 Image Data Collection (International), Indiana University (Indiana, USA), and Emory University (Georgia, USA)

ParticipantsInternal (training, temporal, and real-time validation): 51,592 CXRs; Public: 27,424 CXRs; External (Indiana University): 10,002 CXRs; External (Emory University): 2002 CXRs

Main Outcome and MeasureModel performance assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Precision-Recall curves, and F1 score.

ResultsPatients that were COVID-19 positive had significantly higher COVID-19 Diagnostic Scores (median .1 [IQR: 0.0-0.8] vs median 0.0 [IQR: 0.0-0.1], p < 0.001) than patients that were COVID-19 negative. Pre-implementation the AI-model performed well on temporal validation (AUROC 0.8) and external validation (AUROC 0.76 at Indiana U, AUROC 0.72 at Emory U). The model was noted to have unrealistic performance (AUROC > 0.95) using publicly available databases. Real-time model performance was unchanged over 19 weeks of implementation (AUROC 0.70). On subgroup analysis, the model had improved discrimination for patients with ""severe"" as compared to ""mild or moderate"" disease, p < 0.001. Model performance was highest in Asians and lowest in whites and similar between males and females.

Conclusions and RelevanceAI-based diagnostic tools may serve as an adjunct, but not replacement, for clinical decision support of COVID-19 diagnosis, which largely hinges on exposure history, signs, and symptoms.

We generated 40 features in the training cohort (22 healthy donors [HD] and 105 multiple sclerosis [MS] patients) and compared their intraclass correlation coefficient, fold-change between HD and MS and correlations with relevant clinical and imaging outcomes. We assembled the best features into machine-learning models and examined their performance in the independent validation cohort (56 MS patients).

We show that by aggregating multiple neurological functions, complex tests such as spiral tracing are susceptible to intra-individual variations, decreasing their reproducibility and thus, clinical utility. Simple tests, reproducibly measuring single function(s) that can be aggregated to increase sensitivity are preferable in app design.",NA,medrxiv

CPI-613, a lipoic acid analogue that interferes with enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, has demonstrated clinical activity in lethal malignancies including relapsed or therapy refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AMLs)2,3 and Phase III trials are ongoing1. Using metabolomics, we investigated blood and bone marrow samples from a cohort of 29 relapsed or refractory AML patients involved in Phase I and II studies undergoing CPI-613 treatment (NCT01768897, NCT02484391) including 13 that achieved a complete response. We show that CPI-613 treatment in patients induced defined alterations related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and associated redox, anabolic and catabolic metabolism. These findings are consistent with targeting of several ketoacid dehydrogenase (KADH) enzymes that use lipoic acid as a cofactor and are related to mitochondrial metabolism. The alterations were observed systemically but were more pronounced within the leukemic bone marrow microenvironment consistent with its mechanistic target. Machine learning revealed that metabolic status and changes associated with mitochondrial metabolism were predictive of treatment response, indicating that mechanism-based metabolite biomarkers to a targeted metabolic cancer therapy may be feasible. Finally, we confirm using isotope tracing and flux analysis that these effects are due to disruptions to substrate utilization into the mitochondria. Our findings provide evidence that a tolerated, anti-cancer therapeutic can act by targeting mitochondrial metabolism in humans.",NA,medrxiv

DesignRetrospective cohort study.

MethodsEyes with [&ge;]5 reliable standard automated perimetry (SAP) tests were identified from the Duke Glaucoma Registry. Mean deviation (MD) values from each visual field and associated timepoints were collected. These data were modeled using ordinary least square (OLS) regression as well as linear mixed models using either the Gaussian, Student t, or log-gamma (LG) distributions as the prior distribution for random effects. Model fit was compared using the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC). Simulated eyes of varying initial disease severity and rates of progression were created to assess the accuracy of each Bayesian model in predicting the rate of change and likelihood of declaring progression.

ResultsA total of 52,900 visual fields from 6,558 eyes of 3,981 subjects were included. Mean follow-up period was 8.7{+/-}4.0 years, with an average of 8.1{+/-}3.7 visual fields per eye. The LG model produced the lowest WAIC, demonstrating optimal model fit. Compared to the Gaussian model, the LG model classified almost twice as many eyes as fast progressors. In simulations, the LG model declared progression earlier than OLS (P<0.001) and had the greatest accuracy in predicted slopes (P<0.001). In contrast, the Gaussian model significantly underestimated rates of progression among fast and catastrophic progressors.

ConclusionsLinear mixed models using the LG distribution to model random effects outperformed conventional approaches for estimating rates of SAP MD loss in a population with glaucoma.",NA,medrxiv

But in the middle of 2020, vaccine effectiveness, safety, and the timeline for when a vaccine would be approved and distributed to the public was uncertain. To support public health decision making, we solicited trained forecasters and experts in vaccinology and infectious disease to provide monthly probabilistic predictions from July to September of 2020 of the efficacy, safety, timing, and delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine. We found, that despite sparse historical data, a consensus--a combination of human judgment probabilistic predictions--can quantify the uncertainty in clinical significance and timing of a potential vaccine. The consensus underestimated how fast a therapy would show a survival benefit and the high efficacy of approved COVID-19 vaccines. However, the consensus did make an accurate prediction for when a vaccine would be approved by the FDA. Compared to individual forecasters, the consensus was consistently above the 50th percentile of the most accurate forecasts. A consensus is a fast and versatile method to build probabilistic predictions of a developing vaccine that is robust to poor individual predictions. Though experts and trained forecasters did underestimate the speed of development and the high efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, consensus predictions can improve situational awareness for public health officials and for the public make clearer the risks, rewards, and timing of a vaccine.",NA,medrxiv

Redirecting certain patients to sub-acute healthcare may be beneficial and suitable. We examined if ED interventions conducted on non-emergent paramedic transported patients could be conducted in sub-acute health centres.

MethodsA RAND/UCLA modified Delphi study was conducted. Twenty emergency and primary care physicians rated the suitability of the 150 most frequently recorded interventions for completion in sub-acute healthcare centres and provided comments to augment ratings. Interventions were performed on non-emergent adult patients transported by paramedics to an ED, and abstracted from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System database (January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2018). We used two rounds of a modified Delphi process and set consensus at 70% agreement.

ResultsConsensus was reached on 146 (97.3%) interventions; 103 interventions (68.7%) were suitable for sub-acute centres, 43 (28.7%) for ED only; 4 (2.6%) did not receive consensus. For sub-acute centres, all 103 interventions were rated for urgent care centres; walk-in medical centres were applicable for 46 (30.6%) and nurse practitioner-led clinics for 47 (31.3). Diagnostic imaging availability, physician preferences and staffing were determining factors for discrepancies in sub-acute centre ratings.

InterpretationThe majority of included ED interventions performed on non-emergent patients transported by paramedics were identified as suitable for urgent care clinics, with one-third being suitable for either walk-in medical centres or nurse practitioner-led clinics. In combination with additional patient details and supports, knowledge of interventions suitable for sub-acute healthcare centres will inform a patient classification model for paramedic-initiated redirection of patients from ED.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been instrumental in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. How- ever, as we ease restrictions, widespread implementation of COVID- 19 vaccines is essential to prevent its resurgence. In this work, we addressed the adequacy and deficiency of vaccine uptake within California and the possibility and severity of resurgence of COVID-19 as restrictions are lifted given the current vaccination rates. We implemented a real-time Bayesian data assimilation approach to provide projections of incident cases and deaths in California following the reopening of its economy on June 15, 2021. We implemented scenarios that vary vaccine uptake prior to reopening, and transmission rates and effective population sizes following the reopening. For comparison purposes, we adopted a baseline scenario using the current vaccination rates, which projects a total 11,429 cases and 429 deaths in a 15-day period after reopening. We used posterior estimates based on CA historical data to provide realistic model parameters after reopening. When the transmission rate is increased after reopening, we projected an increase in cases by 21.8% and deaths by 4.4% above the baseline after reopening. When the effective population is increased after reopening, we observed an increase in cases by 51.8% and deaths by 12.3% above baseline. A 30% reduction in vaccine uptake alone has the potential to increase cases and deaths by 35% and 21.6%, respectively. Conversely, increasing vaccine uptake by 30% could decrease cases and deaths by 26.1% and 17.9%, respectively. As California unfolds its plan to reopen its economy on June 15, 2021, it is critical that social distancing and public behavior changes continue to be promoted, particularly in communities with low vaccine uptake. The Centers of Disease Controls (CDC) recommendation to ease mask- wearing for fully vaccinated individuals despite major inequities in vaccine uptake in counties across the state highlights some of the logistical challenges that society faces as we enthusiastically phase out of this pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

An increasing number of countries report parasites that carry hrp2 and/or hrp3 gene deletions, resulting in false negative test results. Molecular surveillance of hrp2 and hrp3 deletions is crucial but adequate protocols have been lacking.

Methods and FindingsWe have developed novel assays for deletion typing based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), targeting hrp2 exon1, hrp2 exon 2, and hrp3. In the ddPCR assay, hrp2 or hrp3 and a control gene were quantified with very high accuracy in a single tube. The theoretical limit of detection of the ddPCR assay was 0.33 parasites/uL, and thus well suited for typing of low-density asymptomatic infections. The deletion was reliably detected in mixed infections with wild-type and hrp2-deleted parasites when the proportion of parasites carrying the deletion was >40%. For a side-by-side comparison with the conventional nested PCR (nPCR) assay, 248 samples from asymptomatic individuals from western Kenya were screened in triplicate by ddPCR and nPCR. No deletions were observed by ddPCR, while by nPCR no band for hrp2 was observed in 8% of samples. The ddPCR assay was applied to screen 830 samples from six countries in Africa and South America. No or very few deletions were observed in Kenya (n=241), Zanzibar/Tanzania (n=91), and Ghana (n=223). In southwestern Ethiopia, 1/47 (2.1%) samples carried hrp2 deletion, and 35/47 (74.5%) hrp3 deletions. In Brazil, 87/187 (46.5%) samples carried hrp2 deletions, and 116/187 (62%) hrp3 deletions. In Ecuador, no hrp2 deletions were observed, but 22/41 (53.7%) samples carried hrp3 deletions.

ConclusionsCompared to nPCR, the ddPCR assay minimizes the risk of false-negative results (i.e. hrp2 deletion observed when the sample is wild type), increases sensitivity, and greatly reduces the number of reactions that need to be run. Pronounced differences in the prevalence of deletion were observed among sites, with more hrp3 than hrp2 deletions.",NA,medrxiv

PBE-QAG measures body awareness during physical activity and includes dimensions of body-mind relationship, body acceptance, and awareness of physical skills and limits.

MethodsAdults without pain (n=269), with pain (n=61), with mental health conditions (n=200), and with stroke (n=36) were recruited at the Minnesota State Fair, Highland Fest, and in the Brain Body Mind Lab (University of Minnesota) and completed demographic and clinical questionnaires as well as the PBE-QAG. The PBE-QAG has 12 items, with scores ranging between 0 (totally true) to 4 (totally false). A low total score on the PBE-QAG reflects better body awareness. We evaluated item and person fit, targeting, unidimensionality, person separation reliability (PSR), local item dependence (LID), and differential item functioning (DIF) for demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared with Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA the person mean location in four groups: Adults with or without mental health conditions; and whether those groups did body awareness training.

ResultsUnidimensionality and item fit were obtained after deleting 2 and rescoring 5 items. Seven participants did not fit the model (1.23%). There was minimal floor (5.72%), no ceiling effect (0.00%), and no LID. No DIF was greater than 0.50 logits for any of the variables. The Wright-corrected PSR was 0.96.

Adults with mental health conditions who did not practice body awareness had a higher person mean location [Median (IQR)=0.83(0.89) logits, p<0.0001] versus the other three groups, reflecting lower body awareness.

ConclusionsPBE-QAG demonstrated good item and person fit, but the targeting is off. Therefore, the current version of PBE-QAG is not recommended for use in the general population.

The results reveal that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 measured by LC-MS correlate well with their corresponding RT-PCR readout. The analytical workflow shows similar turnaround times as regular RT-PCR instrumentation with quantitative readout of viral proteins corresponding to cycle thresholds (Ct) equivalents ranging from 21 to 34.

Towards that end, we designed and tested a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air filters of public buses, revealing that air filters could be used as passive fabric sensors for the detection of viral presence. We placed and retrieved filters in the existing HVAC systems of public buses to test for the presence of trapped SARS-CoV-2 RNA using phenol-chloroform extraction and RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 14% (5/37) of public bus filters tested in Seattle, Washington, from August 2020 to March 2021. These results indicate that this sensing system is feasible and that, if scaled, this method could provide a unique lens into the geographically relevant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through public transit rider vectors, pooling samples of riders over time in a passive manner without installing any additional systems on transit vehicles.

To address this, the Movember Global Action Plan 1 Unique tissue microarray (GAP1-UTMA) project constructed a set of unique and richly annotated TMAs from prostate cancer samples obtained from multiple institutions across several global locations.

MethodsThree separate TMA sets were built that differ by purpose and disease state.

ResultsThe intended use of TMA1 is to validate biomarkers that help determine which clinically localized prostate cancers with associated lymph node metastasis have a high risk of progression to lethal castration resistant metastatic disease, and to compare molecular properties of high risk index lesions within the prostate to regional lymph node metastases resected at the time of prostatectomy. TMA2 was designed to address questions regarding risk of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and response to suppression of the androgen receptor/androgen axis, and characterization of the castration-resistant phenotype. TMA3s intended use is to assess and better understand the heterogeneity of molecular markers across different anatomic sites in lethal prostate cancer metastases.

MethodA Pan-India, Cross-sectional, Coronavirus Vaccine-induced Antibody Titre (COVAT) study was conducted that measured SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike binding antibody quantitatively, 21 days or more after the first and second dose of two vaccines in both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) naive and recovered HCW. Primary aim was to analyze antibody response (seropositivity rate and median [inter-quartile range, IQR] antibody titre) following each dose of both vaccines and its correlation to age, sex, blood group, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. Here we report the final results of anti-spike antibody response after the two completed doses.

ResultsAmong the 515 HCW (305 Male, 210 Female), 95.0% showed seropositivity after two doses of both vaccines. Of the 425 Covishield and 90 Covaxin recipients, 98.1% and 80.0% respectively, showed seropositivity. However, both seropositivity rate and median (IQR) rise in anti-spike antibody was significantly higher in Covishield vs. Covaxin recipient (98.1 vs. 80.0%; 127.0 vs. 53 AU/mL; both p<0.001). This difference persisted in 457 SARS-CoV-2 naive cohorts and propensity-matched (age, sex and BMI) analysis of 116 cohorts. While no difference was observed in relation to sex, BMI, blood group and any comorbidities; people with age >60 years or those with type 2 diabetes had a significantly lower seropositivity rates. Both vaccine recipients had similar solicited mild to moderate adverse events and none had severe or unsolicited side effects. In SARS-CoV-2 naive cohorts, sex, presence of comorbidities, and vaccine type were independent predictors of antibody positivity rate in multiple logistic regression analysis.

ConclusionsBoth vaccines elicited good immune response after two doses, although seropositivity rates and median anti-spike antibody titre was significantly higher in Covishield compared to Covaxin arm.

However, it is uncertain whether this relationship is causal. Therefore, we updated a previously conducted systematic review to determine if the literature supports 1) a causal role of maternal prenatal substance use on offspring externalising disorders and 2) whether these associations differ across externalising disorders.

MethodsWe searched Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO and Medline databases. We included studies that examined smoking, alcohol or caffeine use during pregnancy as an exposure, and diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD) and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) in offspring as an outcome. Studies on non-English language, fetal alcohol syndrome and comorbid autism spectrum disorders were excluded. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and where possible meta-analysis was conducted for studies classed as low risk of bias.

ResultsWe included 63 studies. All studies were narratively synthesised, and 7 studies were meta-analysed on smoking and ADHD. The majority of studies (46 studies) investigated the association between smoking and ADHD. Studies which accounted for genetic effects indicate that the association between smoking and ADHD is unlikely to be causal. Studies on alcohol exposure in all the outcomes reported inconsistent findings and no strong conclusions on causality can be made. Studies on caffeine exposure were mostly limited to ADHD and these studies do not support a causal effect.

ConclusionsThere is no causal relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) in offspring. However, given that the majority of identified studies investigated the association between ADHD and smoking exposure, findings with alcohol and caffeine exposures and conduct disorder (CD) and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) need more research, especially using more genetically sensitive designs.",NA,medrxiv

Although several medications have been approved for treating moderate-to-severe COVID-19, no treatment strategy has been established for mild COVID-19 patients who do not require oxygen administration. The spread of SARS -CoV-2 has been mostly through patients with mild COVID-19; therefore, treating patients with mild COVID-19 is critical in society. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antimicrobial agent that has been widely used for bacterial respiratory infectious diseases. Clarithromycin also acts an immunomodulating drug and suppresses cytokine storms in viral respiratory diseases, including influenza infection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clarithromycin in patients with mild COVID-19.

Methods and analysisThis is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled, 3-armed parallel group comparison, exploratory trial. Subjects with mild COVID-19 pneumonia who did not require oxygen administration were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to Group A (administration of clarithromycin 800 mg/day), Group B (administration of clarithromycin 400 mg/day), or Group C (standard treatment without clarithromycin). The primary endpoint was the number of days required to improve clinical symptoms as measured by the severity score. Secondary endpoints included days to recover the body temperature, proportion of subjects with oxygen administration, inflammatory cytokines, viral load, serum immunoglobulins, peripheral blood lymphocytes, blood biomarkers, and pneumonia infiltrations.

However, little attention has been paid to the detection of subtle physiological changes caused by evolutive pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we investigated the ability of deep learning models to detect anomalies in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans of recently diagnosed and untreated (de novo) patients with Parkinsons disease (PD). We evaluated two families of auto-encoders, fully convolutional and variational auto-encoders. The models were trained with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameter maps of healthy controls. Then, reconstruction errors computed by the models in different brain regions allowed to classify controls and patients with ROC AUC up to 0.81. Moreover, the white matter and the subcortical structures, particularly the substantia nigra, were identified as the regions the most impacted by the disease, in accordance with the physio-pathology of PD. Our results suggest that deep learning-based anomaly detection models, even trained on a moderate number of images, are promising tools for extracting robust neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Interestingly, such models can be seamlessly extended with additional quantitative MRI parameters and could provide new knowledge about the physio-pathology of neuro-degenerative diseases.",NA,medrxiv

Studies of lung microbiome taxonomy often reveal only subtle differences between health and disease, but microbial host response may distinguish members of similar communities in different populations.

ObjectivesMagnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) has been applied to the gut microbiome to identify numbers and types of bacteria eliciting a humoral response. We adapted this technique to examine populations of immunoglobulin-bound bacteria and investigate the lung microbiota in HIV as a representative disease.

Methods42 people living with HIV (PLWH) and 22 HIV-uninfected individuals underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). We separated immunoglobulin G-bound bacteria using MACS and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We analyzed sequences and quantified BAL cytokines and bacterial rRNA copy numbers.

Measurements and Main ResultsImmunoglobulin G-bound bacteria were detectable in the healthy lung microbiota. Comparison of raw BAL by HIV status showed no significant taxonomic differences, but the immunoglobulin-bound lung microbiota differed by HIV status with greater abundance of Pseudomonas in PLWH. BAL cytokine levels were also higher in PLWH, which correlated with increased quantity of immunoglobulin G-bound bacteria.

ConclusionsWe report a novel application of magnetic-activated cell sorting to identify immunoglobulin G-bound bacteria in the lung. This technique identified distinct bacterial communities which differed in composition from raw BAL, revealing differences in health and disease not detected by traditional analyses. Cytokine response was also associated with differential immunoglobulin binding of lung bacteria, suggesting functional importance of these communities.",NA,medrxiv

Parasite accumulation is primarily mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane 1 (PfEMP1). Magnitude of IgG to pRBCs has been associated with reduced risk of MiP in some studies, but associations have been inconsistent. Further, antibody effector mechanisms are poorly understood, and the role of antibody complement interactions is unknown.

MethodsStudying a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women (n=302) from a malaria-endemic province in Papua New Guinea (PNG), we measured the ability of antibodies to fix and activate complement using placental binding pRBCs and PfEMP1 recombinant domains. We determined antibody-mediated complement inhibition of pRBC binding to the placental receptor, chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and associations with protection against placental parasitaemia.

ResultsSome women acquired antibodies that effectively promoted complement fixation on placental-binding pRBCs. Complement fixation correlated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, which dominated the response. There was, however, limited evidence for membrane attack complex activity or pRBC lysis or killing. Importantly, a higher magnitude of complement fixing antibodies was prospectively associated with reduced odds of placental infection at delivery. Using genetically-modified P. falciparum and recombinant PfEMP1 domains, we found that complement-fixing antibodies primarily targeted a specific variant of PfEMP1 (known as VAR2CSA). Furthermore, complement enhanced the ability of antibodies to inhibit pRBC binding to CSA, which was primarily mediated by complement C1q protein.

ConclusionThese findings provide new insights into mechanisms mediating immunity to MiP and reveal potential new strategies for developing malaria vaccines that harness antibody-complement interactions.",NA,medrxiv

Such solutions are outside the scope of classical epidemiological models. Here we construct a deterministic, discrete-time, discrete-population mathematical model which can explain these non-classical phenomena. Our key hypothesis is that with partial preventive measures in place, viral transmission occurs primarily within small, closed groups of family members and friends, which we call clusters. Inter-cluster transmission is infrequent compared to intra-cluster transmission but it is the key to determining the course of the epidemic. If inter-cluster transmission is low enough, we see stable plateau solutions. Above a cutoff level however, such transmission can destabilize a plateau into a huge wave even though its contribution to the population-averaged spreading rate still remains small. We call this the cryptogenic instability. We also find that stochastic effects when case counts are very low may result in a temporary and artificial suppression of an instability; we call this the critical mass effect. Both these phenomena are absent from conventional infectious disease models and militate against the successful management of the epidemic.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsStudying all Norwegian residents aged 1-5, 6-15 and 16-19 years from August 1st 2020 to February 1st 2021 (N= 768 560), we contrasted rates of monthly all-cause primary and specialist health care use before and after testing for SARS-CoV-2 (% relative change), for children testing positive (non-hospitalized in the acute phase) (N=10 306) vs children with no COVID-19 (N=758 254).

ResultsWe found a substantial elevation in short-term primary care use for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the first month following positive test when compared to children testing negative (relative elevation 1-5 years: 325%, 95%CI=296-354; 6-15 years: 434%, 95%CI=415-453; 16-19 years: 360%, 95%CI=342-379).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these vaccines under real-world conditions in the USA.

MethodsEmployees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System, previously not infected with SARS-CoV-2, and working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day COVID-19 vaccination began, were included. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, over the next 5 months, was compared among those who received the vaccine and those who did not, by modeling vaccination as a time-dependent covariate in Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusted for the slope of the epidemic curve as a continuous time-dependent covariate.

ResultsOf the 46866 included employees, 28223 (60%) were vaccinated by the end of the study period. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was much higher among those not vaccinated than those vaccinated. Only 15 (0.7%) of the 2154 SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study occurred among those vaccinated. After adjusting for the slope of the epidemic curve, age, and job type, vaccination was associated with a significantly reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 0.03, 95% C.I. 0.02 - 0.06, p < 0.001), corresponding to a vaccine effectiveness rate of 97.1% (95% CI 94.3 - 98.5). Vaccine effectiveness was 89.2% at 7 days and 95.0% at 14 days after the first vaccine dose.

ConclusionsThe mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are over 97% protective against COVID-19 in the working-age population, with substantial protection possibly apparent within a few days of the first dose.

SummaryThe effectiveness of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was evaluated among 46866 employees in an American healthcare system.

In 2014, Bangladesh established a nationwide, facility-based cholera surveillance system for Vibrio cholerae infection. We sought to measure the sensitivity of this surveillance system to detect cases to assess whether cholera elimination targets outlined by the Bangladesh national control plan can be adequately measured.

MethodsWe overlaid maps of nationally-representative annual V. cholerae seroincidence onto maps of the catchment areas of facilities where confirmatory laboratory testing for cholera was conducted, and identified its spatial complement as surveillance greyspots, areas where cases likely occur but go undetected. We assessed surveillance system sensitivity and changes to sensitivity given alternate surveillance site selection strategies.

ResultsWe estimated that 69% of Bangladeshis (111.7 million individuals) live in surveillance greyspots, and that 23% (25.5 million) of these individuals live in areas with the highest V. cholerae infection rates.

ConclusionsThe cholera surveillance system in Bangladesh has the ability to monitor progress towards cholera elimination goals among 31% of the countrys population, which may be insufficient for accurately measuring progress. Increasing surveillance coverage, particularly in the highest risk areas, should be considered.",NA,medrxiv

Since its original proposal for syphilis screening, group testing has been applied in domains such as fault identification in electrical and computer networks, machine learning, data mining, and cryptography. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to proposals for using group testing in its original context of identifying infected individuals in a population with few tests. Studies suggest that non-adaptive group testing - in which all the tests are determined in advance - for SARS-CoV-2 could help save 20% to 90% of tests depending on the prevalence. However, no systematic approach for comparing different non-adaptive group testing strategies currently exists.

In this paper we develop a software platform for evaluating non-adaptive group testing strategies in both a noiseless setting and in the presence of realistic noise sources, modelled on published experimental observations, which makes them applicable to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the dominant type of tests for SARS-CoV-2. This modular platform can be used with a variety of group testing designs and decoding algorithms. We use it to evaluate the performance of near-doubly-regular designs and a decoding algorithm based on an integer linear programming formulation, both of which are known to be optimal in some regimes. We find savings between 40% and 91% of tests for prevalences up to 10% when a small error (below 5%) is allowed. We also find that the performance degrades gracefully with noise. We expect our modular, user-friendly, publicly available platform to facilitate empirical research into non-adaptive group testing for SARS-CoV-2.",NA,medrxiv

To examine the potential epidemiological and evolutionary impacts of  vaccine nationalism, we extend previous models to include simple scenarios of stockpiling. In general, we find that stockpiling vaccines by countries with high availability leads to large increases in infections in countries with low vaccine availability, the magnitude of which depends on the strength and duration of natural and vaccinal immunity. Additionally, a number of subtleties arise when the populations and transmission rates in each country differ depending on evolutionary assumptions and vaccine availability. Furthermore, the movement of infected individuals between countries combined with the possibility of increases in viral transmissibility may greatly magnify local and combined infection numbers, suggesting that countries with high vaccine availability must invest in surveillance strategies to prevent case importation. Dose-sharing is likely a high-return strategy because equitable allocation brings non-linear benefits and also alleviates costs of surveillance (e.g. border testing, genomic surveillance) in settings where doses are sufficient to maintain cases at low numbers. Across a range of immunological scenarios, we find that vaccine sharing is also a powerful tool to decrease the potential for antigenic evolution, especially if infections after the waning of natural immunity contribute most to evolutionary potential.

DesignRetrospective review of muscle pathology slides of 256 patients diagnosed with DM from January 2009 to December 2020.

SettingSingle center study in a tertiary laboratory for muscle diseases.

ParticipantsA total of 256 patients whose DM diagnosis was pathologically confirmed based on the sarcoplasmic expression of myxovirus resistant protein A (MxA) were included. Of these, 249 patients were positive for one of the 5 DMSAs (seropositive patients, anti-TIF1-{gamma}=87, anti-Mi-2=40, anti-MDA5=29, anti-NXP-2=83, and anti-SAE=10), and 7 were negative for all 5 DMSAs (seronegative patients).

Main outcomes and measuresHistological features stratified according to four pathology domains: muscle fiber, inflammatory, vascular, and connective tissue domains, and histological features of interest by histochemistry, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemical study commonly used in the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy.

ResultsDMSAs significantly associated with characteristic histochemical and immunohistochemical features were as follows: anti-TIF1-{gamma} with vacuolated/punched out fibers (64.7%, P<.001) and perifascicular enhancement in HLA-ABC (75.9%, P<.001); anti-Mi-2 with prominent muscle fiber damage (score 4.8{+/-}2.1, P<.001), inflammatory cell infiltration (score 8.0{+/-}3.0, P=.002), perifascicular atrophy (67.5%, P=.02), perifascicular necrosis (52.5%, P<.001), increased perimysium alkaline phosphatase activity (70.0%, P<.001), central necrotic peripheral regenerating fibers (45.0%, P<.001), and sarcolemmal deposition of the membrane attack complex (67.5%, P<.001); anti-MDA5 with scattered/diffuse staining pattern of MxA (65.5%, P<.001) with less muscle pathology and inflammatory features; and anti-NXP2 with microinfarction (26.5%, P<.001); and anti-SAE and seronegative DM with HLA-DR expression (50.0%, P=.02 and 57.1%, P=.02 respectively).

In order to verify the ""eye-guided scotoma detection method"", we measured 78 eyes of 40 subjects, and examined the measurement results in comparison with the results of measurement by Humphrey perimetry. The results were as follows: (1) Mariotte scotomas were detected in 100% of the eyes tested; (2) The false-negative rate (the percentage of cases where a scotoma was evaluated as a non-scotoma) was less than 10%; (3) The positive point distribution in the low-sensitivity eyes was well matched.

Author summaryConventional perimeters, such as the Goldmann perimeter and Humphrey perimeter, require experienced examiners and space occupying. With either perimeter, subjects eye movements need to be strictly fixed to the fixation target of the device. Other perimeters can monitor fixation and automatically measure the visual field. With the eye-guided scotoma detection method proposed in the current study, subjects feel less burdened since they do not have to fixate on the fixation target of the device and can move their eyes freely. Subjects simply respond to visual targets on the display; then, scotomas can be automatically detected. The novel method yields highly accurate scotoma detection through an algorithm that separates scotomas from non-scotomas.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe have comprehensively analyzed 25 different formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues/organs from autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases (n=8), using detailed histopathological assessment, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using polymerase chain reaction and RNA in situ hybridization, viral protein using immunohistochemistry, and virus particles using transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we confirmed these findings in an independent external autopsy cohort (n=9).

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells, endothelial and mesenchymal cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver, viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. The findings were validated using in situ hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples. Finally, apart from the lung, correlation of virus detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2.

InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 could be observed in virtually all organs, colocalizing with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and viral replication was found across all organ systems. Apart from the respiratory tract, no specific (histo-)morphologic alterations could be assigned to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect the respiratory tract and affect several other major organs. However, on a cellular level, the localization of SARS-CoV-2 and its targets ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have not been described comprehensively.

Added value of this studyWe have analyzed tissue SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR and visualized its localization together with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using in situ hybridization (ISH) in 25 different autopsy tissues. SARS-CoV-2 sense and antisense RNA were detected in 16 tissues/organs, mainly in epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, in endothelial or stromal cells. Detection of viral protein using immunohistochemistry or viral particles using transmission electron microscopy did not yield specific results. Interestingly, apart from the respiratory tract and specifically the lungs, we have not found a specific pathology that would be associated with extrapulmonary viral spread.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe provide a recommendation on using these methods in autopsy diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2. Our data extend the current hypothesis of severe COVID-19 being multisystemic diseases. Our data also provide clear evidence of infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the endothelial cell across all organs, extending the hypothesis on the (micro)vascular involvement in COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

OBJECTIVESThe aim of this study was to describe the frequency, causes, factors, and costs associated with infective endocarditis encounters.

METHODSUtilizing the 2017 national readmission database (NRD), we identified all patients that were admitted with infective endocarditis. These patients were evaluated for the rates, predictors, and costs of unplanned 30 days readmissions. Weighted analysis was performed to obtain nationally representative data.

RESULTS56,357 patients were identified to have been admitted with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis of whom 13,004 patients (23%) were readmitted within 30 days of the index discharge. The most common causes of readmission were septicemia (15.1%), endocarditis and endocardial disease (10.5%), heart failure (9.5%), and complication of cardiovascular device, implant or graft, initial encounter (5.6%). Data showed that there were certain comorbidities that resulted in a higher risk of being readmitted, these include chronic kidney disease, COPD, tobacco use, and hepatic failure. Cost of readmissions per patient was approximately $22,059 (IQR $11,630 - $49,964).

CONCLUSIONSThirty-day unplanned readmissions remain a significant issue affecting nearly 1 in 6 patients with infective endocarditis. This is associated with significant mortality and financial burden.

Shared and diverse underpinnings of psychiatric disorders cannot be systematically understood on the basis of symptom-based categories of mental disorders, which map poorly onto pathophysiological mechanisms. In the MIND-Set study, we make use of current concepts of comorbidity that transcend the current diagnostic categories. We test this approach to psychiatric problems in patients with frequently occurring psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities (excluding psychosis). The main objective of the MIND-Set project is to determine the shared and specific mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and stress-related psychiatric disorders at different observational levels.

MethodsThis is an observational, cross-sectional study. Data from different observational levels as defined in the research domain criteria (RDoC; genetics, physiology, neuropsychology, system level neuroimaging, behavior, self-report and experimental neurocognitive paradigms) are collected over four time points. Included are adult ([&ge;] 18 years), non-psychotic, psychiatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of a stress-related disorder (mood disorder, anxiety disorder and/or addiction disorder) and/or a neurodevelopmental disorder (ASD and/or ADHD). Individuals with no current or past psychiatric diagnosis are included as controls. Data collection started in June 2016 with the aim to include a total of 650 patients and 150 healthy controls by 2021. The data collection procedure includes online questionnaires and three subsequent sessions with 1) Standardized clinical examination, physical examination, and blood sampling; 2) Psychological constructs, neuropsychological tests, and biological marker sampling; 3) Neuroimaging measures.

DiscussionThe MIND-Set study enables us to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of non-psychotic psychiatric disorders transdiagnostically. We will identify both shared and disorder-specific markers at different observational levels that can be used as targets for future diagnostic and treatment approaches.",NA,medrxiv

Despite strong heritability and the recent identification of 64 loci of small effect, pathophysiological mechanisms and much of the genetic risk remain unknown. Here, through genome sequencing and linkage and association analyses, we found that rare variants co-segregating with bipolar disorder in large multiply affected families cluster within gene networks enriched for synaptic and nuclear functions. The top variant in this analysis prioritized by statistical association, predicted deleteriousness, and network centrality was a missense variant in the gene encoding D-amino acid oxidase (DAOG131V). Heterologous expression of DAOG131V in human cells resulted in decreased DAO protein abundance and enzymatic activity. In a knock-in mouse harboring this human DAOG131V variant, DaoG130V/+, we similarly found decreased DAO protein abundance, as well as enhanced stress susceptibility and blunted behavioral responses to pharmacological inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). RNA sequencing of cerebellar tissue revealed that DaoG130V resulted in decreased expression of two gene networks that are enriched for synaptic functions and for genes expressed specifically in Purkinje cells and granule neurons. Similar expression changes in both of these gene networks were also identified in the cerebellum of bipolar disorder cases vs. controls. These findings implicate dysregulation of NMDAR signaling and of gene expression in cerebellar neurons in bipolar disorder pathophysiology and provide insight into its genetic architecture.

Herein, we assessed the real-world downstage (T, N stage) effectiveness of immunochemotherapy as induction treatment and explored the proper cycle number for stage III (N2, N3) NSCLC.

MethodsBiopsy confirmed stage III (N2, N3) NSCLC patients who underwent immunochemotherapy between January 1st, 2018, to August 30th, 2019, were identified. Tumor radiologic regression, lymph node down-staging, and pathological response information were collected.

ResultsIn total, 16 patients with stage IIIA NSCLC, 30 with stage IIIB NSCLC, 9 with stage IIIC NSCLC (N2, N3 metastasis) were included. After immunochemotherapy, 25/55 (45.5%) patients achieved an objective response. Ultimately, 33/55 (60.0%) patients received lobectomy plus systemic lymphadenectomy, of whom 18/33 (54.5%) obtained major pathological response (MPR) of the primary lesion, and 24 (72.7%) had pathological-confirmed lymph node downstage (N2-3 to N0-1). Notably, four patients had MPR of the primary lesion but without lymph node downstage. At the time of data cutoff (December 30th, 2020), the median follow-up duration was 9.2 months (IQR 8.0-11.7), 24/33 (72.7%) of patients that had pulmonary resection were progression-free, with 30 of them alive. Binary logistics analysis showed that 3-4 induction cycles were favorably associated with MPR than 1-2 cycles (p = 0.017).

Differentiation of BCG from other members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) is required to diagnose BCG disease, which requires specific management. Current methods for BCG diagnosis are based on mycobacterial culture and conventional PCR; the former is time-consuming and the latter often unavailable. Further, there are reports that certain BCG strains may be associated with a higher rate of adverse events. This study describes the development of a two-step multiplex real-time PCR assay which uses single nucleotide polymorphisms to detect BCG and identify early or late BCG strains. The assay has a limit of detection of 1 pg BCG boiled lysate DNA and was shown to detect BCG in both pure cultures and experimentally infected tissue. Performance was assessed on 19 suspected BCG clinical isolates at Christian Medical College in Vellore, India taken from January 2018 to August 2020. Of these 19 isolates, 10 were identified as BCG (6 early and 4 late strains) and 9 were identified as other MTBC members. Taken together, the results demonstrate the ability of this assay to identify and characterize BCG disease from cultures and infected tissue.

In this context cardiotocography (CTG) is a low cost, well established procedure that has been around for decades, despite lacking consensus regarding its impact on outcomes.

Machine learning emerged as an option for automatic classification of CTG records, as previous studies showed expert level results, but often came at the price of reduced generalization potential.

With that in mind, the present study sought to improve statistical rigor of evaluation towards real world application.

Materials and MethodsIn this study, a dataset of 2126 CTG recordings labeled as normal, suspect or pathological by the consensus of three expert obstetricians was used to create a baseline random forest model.

This was followed by creating a lightgbm model tuned using gaussian process regression and post processed using cross validation ensembling.

Performance was assessed using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) metric over 100 experiment executions, each using a testing set comprised of 30% of data stratified by the class label.

ResultsThe best model was a cross validation ensemble of lightgbm models that yielded 95.82% AUPRC.

ConclusionsThe model is shown to produce consistent expert level performance at a less than negligible cost. At an estimated 0.78 USD per million predictions the model can generate value in settings with CTG qualified personnel and all the more in their absence.",NA,medrxiv

Given the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, transmission associated with air travel is based on what is known about the dynamics of transmission of other respiratory virus infections, especially those due to other coronaviruses and influenza. Our objective was to provide a rapid summary and evaluation of relevant data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard aircraft, report important policy implications, and highlight research gaps requiring urgent attention.

MethodsThis review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar, and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February 2020 to 27 January 2021 and included studies on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard aircraft. We assessed study quality based on five criteria and reported important findings.

ResultsWe included 18 studies on in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2, representing 130 unique flights and two studies on wastewater from aircraft. The overall quality of reporting was low. Two wastewater studies reported PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 samples, but with relatively high Cycle threshold values ranging from 36 to 40. The definition of an index case was very heterogeneous across the studies. The proportion of contacts traced ranged from 0.68% to 100%. In total, the authors successfully traced 2800/19729 passengers, 140/180 crew members, and 8/8 medical staff. Altogether, 273 index cases were reported, with 64 secondary cases. No secondary cases were reported in three studies, each investigating one flight. The secondary attack rate among the studies that followed up >80% of the passengers and crew (including data on 10 flights) varied between 0% and 8.2%. The included studies reported on the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Viral cultures were performed in two studies, with 10 positive results reported. Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in individuals from four flights, with the completeness of genomic similarity ranging from 81-100%.

ConclusionCurrent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted during aircraft travel, but the published data do not permit any conclusive assessment of the likelihood and extent. Furthermore, the quality of evidence from most published studies is low. The variation in study design and methodology restricts the comparison of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting future studies of transmission on aircrafts should be developed.",NA,medrxiv

Hence, the normal body temperature at present needs quantification?

MethodsA longitudinal study on the healthy population of Northen-India were followed-up over 1-year. Participants were advised for self-monitoring of oral temperature with a standard digital thermometer in either left or right sublingual pocket and record it in the thermometry diary. The study was considered complete if the participant had all the three phases of the study (i.e. non-febrile, febrile, and post-febrile phases) or completed the duration of the study.

ResultsThe mean oral temperature of the participants (n=144) during the non-febrile and post-febrile phases (temperature readings=6543) were 98{degrees}F (SD, 0.61) and 98.01{degrees}F (SD, 0.60) respectively (P<0.001). The mean oral temperature during post-febrile phase was found to be 0.01{degrees}F higher than non-febrile phase.

DesignThis was secondary analysis of an evaluation using semi-structured interviews.

MethodsConducted at a single National Health Service (NHS) university hospital in the United Kingdom between May-July 2020. Forty-eight operational leads and nurses participated in semi-structured interviews which were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a framework analysis.

ResultsTwo overarching themes emerged relating to the patient experience and nursing experience. There were both positive and negative elements associated with virtual care and remote working related to these themes. However, the majority of nurses found virtual clinics were useful when proper resources were provided, and managerial strategies were put in place to support them. Participants felt virtual care could benefit many but not all patient groups moving forward, and that flexibility around working from home would be desirable in the future.

ConclusionVirtual care and remote working were implemented to accommodate the restrictions imposed because of the pandemic. The benefits of these changes to nurses and patients support these being business as usual. However, clear policies are needed to ensure nurses feel supported when working remotely and there are robust assessments in place to ensure virtual care is provided to patients who have access to the necessary technology.

ImpactThis was a study of the move to virtual care and remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the existing data based on socio-economic surveys provide accurate estimates of food insecurity indicators at state and national level, due to small sample sizes, the surveys cannot be used directly to produce reliable estimates at the district or lower administrative levels. The availability of reliable and representative disaggregated measures of food insecurity is necessary for effective policy planning and monitoring, as food insecurity is often distributed unevenly within relatively small areas.

This article explores a small area estimation (SAE) approach to derive reliable and representative estimates of food insecurity prevalence (FIP), gap (FIG), and severity (FIS) among people in different districts of the rural areas of the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (EIGP) region by linking the latest round of available data from the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey collected by the National Sample Survey Office of India as well as the latest available Indian Population Census data. District-specific food insecurity indictors such as FIP, FIG, and FIS were estimated based on a recommended threshold of per capita caloric intake of 2400 kilocalories per day, as defined by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Spatial maps showing district level inequality in the distribution of the indicators of food insecurity among the population in EIGP region are also produced. Our disaggregated estimates can provide district-specific focused insights into food insecurity to policy-analysts and decision-makers, and could thereby prove to be useful and relevant to the U.N.

A significant uncertainty that would improve interpretation of wastewater monitoring data is the intensity and timing with which individuals shed RNA from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into wastewater. By combining wastewater and case surveillance data sets from a university campus during a period of heightened surveillance, we inferred that individual shedding of RNA into wastewater peaks on average six days (50% uncertainty interval (UI): 6 - 7; 95% UI: 4 - 8) following infection, and that wastewater measurements are highly overdispersed (negative binomial dispersion parameter, k = 0.39 (95% credible interval: 0.32 - 0.48)).

Testing barriers have prohibited adequate screening for SARS COV2, resulting in significant delays in treatment provision and commencement of outbreak control measures. This study aimed to generate evidence on the performance and implementation characteristics of the BD Veritor rapid antigen test as compared to the gold standard test for diagnosis of SARS COV2 in Kenya.

MethodsThis was a field test performance evaluation in symptomatic and asymptomatic adults undergoing testing for SARS COV2. Recruited participants were classified as SARS-CoV2-positive based on the locally implemented gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. 272 antigen tests were performed with simultaneous gold standard testing, allowing us to estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the BD Veritor rapid antigen test platform. Implementation characteristics were assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research for feasibility, acceptability, turn-around time, and ease-of-use metrics.

Results and DiscussionWe enrolled 97 PCR negative symptomatic and 128 PCR negative asymptomatic, and 28 PCR positive symptomatic and 19 PCR positive asymptomatic participants. Compared to the gold standard, the sensitivity of the BD Veritor antigen test was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.6 to 100.0) while the specificity was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96 to 100). The sensitivity of BD Veritor antigen test was higher among symptomatic (100%) compared to asymptomatic (84%) participants, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was also a lack of association between cycle threshold value and sensitivity of BD Veritor test.

Testing barriers have prohibited adequate screening for SARS COV2, resulting in significant delays in treatment provision and commencement of outbreak control measures. This study aimed to generate evidence on the performance and implementation characteristics of the BD Veritor rapid antigen test as compared to the gold standard test for diagnosis of SARS COV2 in Kenya.

MethodsThis was a field test performance evaluation in symptomatic and asymptomatic adults undergoing testing for SARS COV2. Recruited participants were classified as SARS-CoV2-positive based on the locally implemented gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. 272 antigen tests were performed with simultaneous gold standard testing, allowing us to estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the BD Veritor rapid antigen test platform. Implementation characteristics were assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research for feasibility, acceptability, turn-around time, and ease-of-use metrics.

Results and DiscussionWe enrolled 97 PCR negative symptomatic and 128 PCR negative asymptomatic, and 28 PCR positive symptomatic and 19 PCR positive asymptomatic participants. Compared to the gold standard, the sensitivity of the BD Veritor antigen test was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.6 to 100.0) while the specificity was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96 to 100). The sensitivity of BD Veritor antigen test was higher among symptomatic (100%) compared to asymptomatic (84%) participants, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was also a lack of association between cycle threshold value and sensitivity of BD Veritor test. The BD Veritor test had quick turnaround time and minimal resource requirements, and laboratory personnel conducting testing felt that it was easier to use than the gold standard RT-PCR.

ConclusionThe BD Veritor rapid antigen test exhibited excellent sensitivity and specificity when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection among both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in varied population settings in Kenya.

We aimed to determine the levels of vaccine-induced neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. To do so, we undertook a single-centre cross-sectional study of health care workers (HCWs) and outpatients with immunodeficiencies (IDP) based at the same critical care tertiary NHS Trust, following a single dose of either BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccines. Data revealed low neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in IDPs, with only 5% and 3% showing detectable neutralisation of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively. In contrast, healthy HCWs without a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated a wide range of nAb titres post-vaccination with responses significantly lower than HCWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralisation of VOCs with the E484K mutation (B.1.351 and P.1) were consistently lower in HCWs in the absence of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001). Notably, in vaccinated HCWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was a significant increase of neutralising titres post-vaccination to all variants, compared to their pre-vaccination neutralisation titres.

MethodsThe study is based on the analysis of pregnant women with COVID-19, in 5 hospitals in the Republic of Panama. The inclusion criteria were: Patients with or without symptoms, positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the period from March 23 to 6 months after, whose births were attended in one of those 5 hospitals and who signed the consent. Data was obtained at the time of diagnosis of the infection and at the time of termination of pregnancy for the mother and newborn.

Results253 patients met the inclusion criteria. Most were diagnosed in the third trimester (89.3%). 10.3% of the patients presented in a severe form of COVID-19. The most frequent complication was pre-eclampsia and if we add gestational hypertension they represent 21.2%; most of the patients terminated the pregnancy by caesarean section (58%). 26.9% (95% CI 21.3-32.9%) of the births were premature, and perinatal mortality was 5.4% (95% CI 3.0-9.0%). There was a need for mechanical ventilation in 5.9% (95% CI 3.6-9.6%) of the cohort and there were four maternal deaths (1.6% - 95% CI 0.6-4.0%).

ConclusionsThis study of pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and diagnosed with RT-PCR shows serious maternal complications such as high admission to the ICU, need for mechanical ventilation and one death in every 64 infected.

Among them are challenges to the educational system where college administrators are struggling with the questions of how to reopen in-person activities while prioritizing student safety. To help address this challenge, we developed a flexible computational framework to model the spread and control of COVID-19 on a residential college campus. The modeling framework accounts for heterogeneity in social interactions, activities, disease progression, and control interventions. The relative contribution of classroom, dorm, and social activities to disease transmission was explored. We observed that the dorm has the highest contribution to disease transmission followed by classroom and social activities. Without vaccination, frequent (weekly) random testing coupled with risk reduction measures (e.g. facial mask,) in classroom, dorm, and social activities is the most effective control strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses. Moreover, since random screening testing allows for the successful and early detection of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, it successfully reduces the transmission rate such that the maximum quarantine capacity is far lower than expected to further reduce the economic burden caused from quarantine. With vaccination, herd immunity is estimated to be achievable by 50% to 80% immunity coverage. In the absence of herd immunity, simulations indicate that it is optimal to keep some level of transmission risk reduction measures in classroom, dorm, and social activities, while testing at a lower frequency. Though our quantitative results are likely provisional on our model assumptions, extensive sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of their qualitative nature.

The objective of this study was to assess the temporal association between serum vitamin D levels and COVID-19.

DesignA single-institution case-control study and a historical cohort study

SettingUniversity of California San Diego (UCSD) Health System in San Diego, California

ParticipantsPatients testing positive for COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 with serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) measured within 180 days of diagnosis. Patients were separated based on whether 25(OH)D was measured before (n=107; ""pre-diagnosis"") or after (n=203; ""post-diagnosis"") COVID-19 diagnosis. Subjects with 25(OH)D assessments prior to COVID-19 diagnosis were evaluated using a case-control study design, while subjects with 25(OH)D measured after COVID-19 diagnosis were analyzed with a historical cohort study design.

Primary and Secondary Outcome MeasuresIn the pre-diagnosis study, a conditional logistic regression was performed using COVID-19 infection status as the binary dependent variable. In the post-diagnosis study, an ordinary least squares regression was performed using serum 25(OH)D levels as the continuous dependent variable.

ResultsSerum 25(OH)D levels were not associated with the odds of subsequently testing positive for COVID-19 (OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.02, p = 0.982). However, COVID-19 positive individuals had serum 25(OH)D measurements that were lower by 2.70 ng/mL (95% CI: -5.19 to -0.20, p = 0.034) compared to controls.

ConclusionsIn our study population, serum 25(OH)D levels were not associated with risk of testing positive for COVID-19 but were reduced in subjects after being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. These results raise the possibility that reduced serum 25(OH)D may be a consequence and not a cause of COVID-19 infection.",NA,medrxiv

T cell responses play a role in protection from reinfection and severe disease, but the potential for spike mutations to affect T cell immunity is poorly studied. We assessed both neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in 44 South African COVID-19 patients infected either with B.1.351, now dominant in South Africa, or infected prior to its emergence ( first wave), to provide an overall measure of immune evasion. We show for the first time that robust spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were detectable in B.1.351-infected patients, similar to first wave patients. Using peptides spanning only the B.1.351 mutated regions, we identified CD4 T cell responses targeting the wild type peptides in 12/22 (54.5%) first wave patients, all of whom failed to recognize corresponding B.1.351-mutated peptides (p=0.0005). However, responses to the mutated regions formed only a small proportion (15.7%) of the overall CD4 response, and few patients (3/44) mounted CD8 responses that targeted the mutated regions. First wave patients showed a 12.7 fold reduction in plasma neutralization of B.1.351. This study shows that despite loss of recognition of immunodominant CD4 epitope(s), overall CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to B.1.351 are preserved. These observations may explain why, despite substantial loss of neutralizing antibody activity against B.1.351, several vaccines have retained the ability to protect against severe COVID-19 disease.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, RT-PCR tests have been considered the gold standard due to their high sensitivity and specificity. However, RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to return positive results when administered to individuals who are past the infectious stage of the disease. Meanwhile, antigen-based tests are often treated as a less accurate substitute for RT-PCR, however, new evidence suggests they may better reflect infectiousness. Consequently, the two test types may each be most optimally deployed in different settings. Here, we present an epidemiological model with surveillance testing and coordinated isolation in two congregate living settings (a nursing home and a university dormitory system) that considers test metrics with respect to viral culture, a proxy for infectiousness. Simulations show that antigen-based surveillance testing coupled with isolation greatly reduces disease burden and carries a lower economic cost than RT-PCR-based strategies. Antigen and RT-PCR tests perform different functions toward the goal of reducing infectious disease burden and should be used accordingly.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of primary peer-reviewed published literature reporting on the prevalence of the symptoms, sequelae and difficulties conducting usual activities [&ge;]4 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. We adapted a previous search strategy used by the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and updated it to search for new research published until January 15, 2021 in Embase, Medline, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Central. Two independent reviewers screened references; one reviewer extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty in the evidence while another verified them. Prevalence data from laboratory-confirmed individuals were meta-analyzed, where appropriate, using a random effects model and synthesized separately in the short- and long-term periods after COVID-19 diagnosis; data from clinically-diagnosed populations were synthesized narratively.

ResultsOf the 2807 unique citations, 36 observational studies met our inclusion criteria. Over 100 post COVID-19 conditions were reported in laboratory-confirmed individuals. Eighty-three percent (95%CI: 65-93%; low certainty) and 56% (95%CI: 34-75%; very low certainty) reported persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the short- and long-term, respectively. The most prevalent symptoms in both periods included: fatigue, general pain or discomfort, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath and anxiety or depression (point estimates ranging from 22-51%; low to very low certainty).

InterpretationOur data indicate that a substantial proportion of individuals reported a variety of symptoms [&ge;]4 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Due to low certainty in the evidence, further research is needed to determine the true burden of post COVID-19 conditions.",NA,medrxiv

Antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are a cheap and rapid alternative to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, but there is little data about their performance under real life conditions in tropical countries.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the performance of a standard Ag-RDT in a population of a major hospital in northern Ghana.

MethodsProspective, cross-sectional, blinded verification of the performance of the SD Biosensor Standard Q SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT under real life conditions in 135 symptomatic patients and 58 contacts of RT-PCR positives at Tamale Teaching Hospital in February 2021. Nasopharyngeal samples were taken under standard conditions and tested against RT-PCR in the hospital laboratory.

Results193 participants (median age 35 years, 109 male) were included into the study for which both RT-PCR test and Ag-RDT results were available. A total of 42 (22%) were RT-PCR-positive. Of the 42 RT-PCR-positives, 27 were Ag-RDT positive, resulting in a sensitivity of 64% (95% CI 49-79). Sensitivity among symptomatic patients was 58% (95% CI 38-78). 123 were identified Ag-RDT negatives of the 151 RT-PCR negatives, resulting in a specificity of 81% (95% CI 75-87).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs appear to have a rather low sensitivity and particularly a low specificity under real life conditions in Africa. The role of existing Ag-RDTs in countries with high-temperature climates and limited resources still needs more data and discussion.",NA,medrxiv

DesignCross-sectional study.

SettingStaff and parents/guardian participants in the 132 primary schools and 20 secondary schools participating in sKIDs and sKIDsPLUS surveillances.

Main outcome measurePrevalence of control measures implemented in Autumn 2020, parental and staff perception of ease of implementation and acceptability of conducting school surveillance studies.

ResultsIn total, 56/152 (37%) schools participating in Public Health Englands sKIDs study of COVID in schools accepted the invitation to participate in the survey. By 28 December 2020, 1,953 parent and 986 staff respondents had completed the online questionnaire. While more than half the parents were positive about their children returning to school, roughly a third reported being a little anxious. 90% and 82% of primary and secondary school parents were either completely or partly reassured by the preventive measures implemented in their schools. Among staff, 80% of primary staff and 87% of secondary school staff felt that they were at higher risk of COVID-19 because of their profession; only 52% of primary school staff and 38% of secondary school staff reportedly felt safe. According to the teaching staff, most preventive measures were well-implemented apart from requiring 2-metre distancing between staff. For students, maintaining the 2-metre distance was reported to be particularly difficult. By extension, secondary schools also struggled to maintain small groups at all times or ensuring that the same staff were assigned to each student group (a problem also commonly reported by parents).

ConclusionsVariable implementation of infection control measures was reported by staff and parents. Whilst the majority were not worried about returning to school, some parents and staff, were concerned about returning to school and the risks posed to children, staff and household members.

As the symptoms and impact of post-stroke aphasia are heterogeneous, it is important to understand how topographical lesion heterogeneity in patients with aphasia is associated with different domains of language impairments. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of neuroanatomical basis in post-stroke aphasia through coordinate based meta-analysis of voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping studies.

MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of lesion-symptom mapping studies in post-stroke aphasia. We obtained coordinate-based functional neuroimaging data for 2,007 individuals with aphasia from 25 studies that met predefined inclusion criteria.

ResultsOverall, our results revealed that the distinctive patterns of lesions in aphasia are associated with different language functions and tasks. Damage to the insular-motor areas impaired speech with preserved comprehension and a similar pattern was observed when the lesion covered the insular-motor and inferior parietal lobule. Lesions in the frontal area severely impaired speaking with relatively good comprehension. The repetition-selective deficits only arise from lesions involving the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Damage in the anterior-to-posterior temporal cortex was associated with semantic deficits.

ConclusionThe association patterns of lesion topography and specific language deficits provide key insights into the specific underlying language pathways. Our meta-analysis results strongly support the dual pathway model of language processing, capturing the link between the different symptom complexes of aphasias and the different underlying location of damage.",NA,medrxiv

Many countries are vaccinating or considering vaccinating pregnant women with limited available data about the safety of this strategy. Early identification of safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines, including their components, or their technological platforms is therefore urgently needed.

MethodsWe conducted a rapid systematic review, as the first phase of an ongoing full systematic review, to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women, including their components, and their technological platforms (whole virus, protein, viral vector or nucleic acid) used in other vaccines, following the Cochrane methods and the PRISMA statement for reporting (PROSPERO-CRD42021234185).

We searched literature databases, COVID-19 and pregnancy registries from inception February 2021 without time or language restriction and explored the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews retrieved. We selected studies of any methodological design that included at least 50 pregnant women or pregnant animals exposed to the vaccines that were selected for review by the COVAX MIWG in August 2020 or their components or platforms included in the COVID-19 vaccines, and evaluated adverse events during pregnancy and the neonatal period.

Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through the COVIDENCE web software and performed the data extraction through a previously piloted online extraction form. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

ResultsWe identified 6768 records, 256 potentially eligible studies were assessed by full-text, and 37 clinical and non-clinical studies (38 reports, involving 2,397,715 pregnant women and 56 pregnant animals) and 12 pregnancy registries were included.

Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries. The most frequent study design was cohort studies (n=21), followed by surveillance studies, randomized controlled trials, and registry analyses. Most studies (76%) allowed comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women (n=25) or animals (n=3) and reported exposures during the three trimesters of pregnancy.

The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines (n=24), followed by aluminum-based adjuvants (n=11). Aluminum phosphate was used in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Fusion candidate vaccines (n=3) and Tdap vaccines (n=3). Different aluminum-based adjuvants were used in hepatitis vaccines. The replication-deficient simian adenovirus ChAdOx1 was used for a Rift Valley fever vaccine. Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines that also used lipid nanoparticles. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03) - corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns.

ConclusionThis rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines that were selected for review by the COVAX MIWG or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines. However, the need for further data on several vaccine platforms and components is warranted given their novelty. Our findings support current WHO guidelines recommending that pregnant women may consider receiving COVID-19 vaccines, particularly if they are at high risk of exposure or have comorbidities that enhance the risk of severe disease.",NA,medrxiv

As S. argenteus sepsis leads to mortality similar to S. aureus, we determined the potential for person-to-person transmission, to evaluate future outbreak risk.

MethodsWe used whole-genome sequencing to characterise S. argenteus and investigate phylogenetic relationships between isolates. Participant colonisation with S. aureus and skin and soft tissue infection acquisition were recorded.

ResultsAll six S. argenteus strains were spa-type t5078, ST2250. Strains were detected in 4/40 recruits in the same troop (training cohort) in weeks 1, 6 or 15 of training. No mec, tsst or LukPV genes were detected. We identified differences of 10-35 core SNPs between S. argenteus from different recruits. In two recruits, two S. argenteus strains were isolated; these could be distinguished by 3 and 15 core SNPs in each case. S. argenteus was not identified in any one of the other 21 participating troops (1,012 recruits).

ConclusionsThe identification of S. argenteus within a single troop from the total recruit population supports a common source for transmission, supported by SNP analysis. The high number of SNPs between some isolates may indicate a common source of diverse isolates or a high level of S. argenteus mutation in carriage. S. argenteus ST2250 is a newly recognised lineage; a better understanding of the frequency of genetic changes during transmission and transition from asymptomatic carriage to disease is required.",NA,medrxiv

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased substantially in younger adults; however, its role in early-onset CRC remains unidentified.

DesignWe conducted a claims-based nested case-control study using IBM(R) MarketScan(R) Commercial Database (2006-2015). Incident early-onset CRC diagnosed at ages 18-49 were identified by ICD-9-CM diagnosis code, and the first coded diagnostic pathology date was assigned as the index date. Controls were frequency matched with cases. Type 2 diabetes, stratified by severity, was identified through ICD-9-CM using the Klabunde algorithm. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls).

ResultsA total of 6001 early-onset CRC and 52104 controls were included. Type 2 diabetes was associated with an increased risk of early-onset CRC (5.0% in cases vs. 3.7% in controls; OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.41). The positive association was more pronounced for uncontrolled (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.67) or complicated (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.08-2.35) type 2 diabetes compared to controlled diabetes (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.36). The positive association was driven by proximal (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77) and distal (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.15) colon cancer but not rectal cancer.

ConclusionsIndividuals with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of early-onset CRC, with stronger associations for uncontrolled/complicated diabetes. The rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes among younger adults in the US may partially contribute to the increasing incidence of early-onset CRC.",NA,medrxiv

Genetic and other investigations have failed to identify an etiology or diagnostic test. Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors (NTs) and cerebrospinal fluid inflammation point to an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Here, we screened antibodies from a curated cohort of ROHHAD patients (n=9) and controls (n=150) using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Our ROHHAD cohort exhibited frequent association with NTs (8/9) and features consistent with autoimmune etiology. Autoantibodies to Zinc finger and SCAN domain-containing protein 1 (ZSCAN1) were discovered and orthogonally validated in 7 of 9 ROHHAD patients, all of whom had NTs, and shown to be absent in non-ROHHAD pediatric patients with NTs. Notably, human ZSCAN1 expression was confirmed in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human hypothalamus. Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral NT. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in an accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. Lastly, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches in addition to the classical rodent-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsOne hundred and nineteen patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain filled the Five-Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS), and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory--Revised (OCI-R). A latent variable was constructed to represent NA. Multiple regression analysis was conducted, and several indices of relative importance were calculated.

ResultsExcept for Observing, all mindfulness facets had significant bivariate and unique relation with NA. Acting with Awareness was the most important predictor, followed by Nonjudging and Describing. The contribution of Nonreactivity was small. Regarding the second objective, the Observing x Nonjudging and Observing x Nonreactivity interactions were not significant. Finally, the five facets of mindfulness explained about one-half of the variance in obsession and one-fifth of the variance in compulsion. After excluding the shared variance between obsession and compulsion, mindfulness was only related to obsession.

ConclusionExcept for Observing, all mindfulness facets seem to have unique contributions to psychological symptoms; among them, Acting with Awareness seems most important. Current evidence is inconsistent in supporting the dependency of the effect of observing on acceptance. Finally, regarding the relation between mindfulness and OCS, it seems that mindfulness is more related to obsession than compulsion.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsDue to the constraints of privacy-preservation, aggregate metrics and disparate data sources were utilized to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases averted based on a modelling approach adapted from Wymant et al (2021) using the following parameters: number of notifications generated; the probability that a notified individual goes on to become a case; expected fraction of transmissions preventable by strict quarantine after notification; actual adherence to quarantine; and expected size of the full transmission chain if a contact had not been notified.

ResultsThe model was run on a range of secondary attack rates (5.1%-13.706%) and quarantine effectiveness (53% and 64%). Assuming a 12.085% secondary attack rate and 53% quarantine effectiveness, the model shows that 5,500 cases (central 95% range of sensitivity analyses 2,800-8,200) were averted statewide during the first four months of its implementation. Based on an estimated COVID-19 case fatality of 1.4%, WA Notify saved 40-115 lives during the study period.

ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the value of exposure notification tools as a novel public health intervention to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. As new variants emerge and non-essential travel bans are lifted, exposure notification tools may continue to play a valuable role in limiting the spread of COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

Study designA cross-sectional survey was carried out on 1004 Cubans.

MethodsThe survey measured the importance placed on dementia, risk reduction knowledge and the actions to prevent it. Logistic regression was undertaken to identify variables associated with knowledge.

ResultsMost respondents (47.5%) believe that dementia risk reduction should start before age of 40. Cognitive stimulation and physical activities were selected with major frequency. Being older than 48 years, having previous contact with dementia and university education increases the probability of having healthy lifestyles.

ConclusionsThe exploration of demographic variables allows the prediction of likelihood to know about or have positive beliefs in relation to dementia. They should be contemplated into strategies for dementia prevention in Cuban population.",NA,medrxiv

It is worth investigating how stakeholders perceived their adaptability and coping with the accelerated change accompanying COVID-19. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to assess the self-reported adaptability of postgraduate dental learners and their instructors in the context of abrupt transition to distance learning induced by the pandemic.

This study utilized a convergent mixed methods study design. The qualitative and quantitative data were concurrently collected from instructors and learners. The datasets were analyzed independently, and the generated information was integrated using a joint model analysis.

The percentage of average of self-reported adaptability of both groups was 81.15%. The instructors, with a mean of satisfaction of 17.94 ({+/-}1.76), rated their adaptability significantly higher than the learners, with a mean of satisfaction of 15.66 ({+/-}2.77) (p=0.002). The thematic analysis resulted in two interrelated themes: Self and Environment. Within the Self theme, three subthemes surfaced: Cognitions, Emotions, Behaviors. As for the Environment theme, it encapsulated two subthemes: Enablers and Impediments.

The stakeholders perceived themselves to have adapted well to the transition, and SRL appeared as a cornerstone in the adaptation to the accelerated change (accompanying COVID-19). There appeared to be an interplay between the cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on the level of the self as part of the adaptation process. Also, building upon existent models of SRL, this study uncovered that the stakeholders considered the environment to play a crucial role in their adaptation process. This highlights the importance of developing a climate that remains, despite external pressures, conducive to attaining learning and teaching goals. It is also crucial for university-level mental health promotion activities to proactively foster, among learners and instructors, adaptability, building  academic resilience.",NA,medrxiv

Biological aging, the progressive loss of system integrity that occurs as we age is proposed as a modifiable process mediating this health inequality.

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that socioeconomic disparities in cognitive aging in older adults is explained by accelerated biological aging.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingU.S. Health and Retirement Study DNA-methylation sub-study.

ParticipantsN=3,648 (49% male) adults aged 50-100 (M=70, SD=10) with DNA methylation data.

ExposuresSocioeconomic status (SES) was measured from years of education and household wealth. The extent and pace of biological aging were quantified using three DNA-methylation measures: PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPoAm.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCognitive aging was measured from repeated longitudinal assessments of immediate and delayed word recall. Latent growth curve modeling estimated participants level of memory performance and rate of decline over 2-11 follow-up assessments spanning 2-20 years. Models were estimated to assess whether the relationship between SES and memory trajectories was mediated by biological aging.

ResultsOlder adults with lower SES had lower memory performance, faster decline and exhibited accelerated biological aging (SES {beta}=.33, 99% CI[.30-.36], biological-aging measure effect size associations ranged from .08 to .20). Accelerated biological aging was associated with decreased memory performance and faster memory decline (effect-size range .03 to .18). Higher SES was associated with slower biological aging for White and Black men and women, but not Latinx participants. The relationship between biological aging measures and memory was weaker for Black and Latinx participants compared with White people. In mediation analysis, biological aging accounted for 3-9% of the SES-memory gradient in White participants. There was no evidence of mediation in Black or Latinx participants.

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong a national sample of older adults, DNA-methylation measures of biological aging were associated with memory trajectories in White, but not Black or Latinx older adults. These results challenge the assumption that DNA-methylation biomarkers of aging that were developed in primarily White people can quantify aging processes affecting cognition in Black and Latinx older adults.",NA,medrxiv

Five affected subjects with biallelic variants in this gene presented with a phenotype of early-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia, while 12 individuals carried de novo missense variants and showed severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The R740Q mutation, which alone accounts for almost 50% of the mutations identified among our cases, leads to failure of lysosomal hydrolysis by directly impairing acidification of the endolysosomal compartment, causing autophagic dysfunction and severe developmental defect in C. elegans.

Biomedical scientists (BMSs) play an important role in any health care system. However, they are at high risk of exposure to LMSDs. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and the associated risk factors of LMSDs among this group of healthcare professionals.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey (Nordic musculoskeletal) was used to estimate the prevalence of LMSDs among BMSs. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science software version 25. Chi-square was performed to find the significant association between LMSDs and different risk factors.

ResultsThe study included 83 BMSs. Females represented 63.9% and 36.1% were in the age group of 35-44. The overall prevalence of LMSDs was 77.1%. The most prevalent LMSDs were neck, shoulders, and lower back with 50.6%, 49.4%, and 43.4%, respectively. Neck complaints and upper back complaints were found statistically significant with the female gender. Shoulders complaints were associated with pipetting and microscopy. Lower back complaints were associated with pipetting and heavy work at home. A total of 65.57% of BMSs had irregular symptoms of LMSDs, 54.10% experienced moderate pain due to these symptoms, and 44.26% had symptoms that persisted from hours to days.

ConclusionThe study found that the prevalence of LMSDs among BMSs was high. Good knowledge, attitude, practice, and training of ergonomics may minimize the prevalence of LMSDs among BMSs.",NA,medrxiv

Lung function has a strong genetic component but is also affected by environmental factors such as increased exposure to air pollution. How genetic factors and air pollution interact to affect lung function is however less understood.

We conducted a genome-wide gene-air pollution interaction analysis of spirometry measures with three measures of air pollution at home address: particulate matter (PM2.5 & PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in approximately 300,000 unrelated European individuals from UK Biobank. We explored air pollution interactions with previously identified lung function signals and determined their combined interaction effect using a polygenic risk score (PRS).

We identified seven genome-wide interaction signals (P < 5 x 10-8), and a further ten suggestive interaction signals (P < 5 x 10-7). We found statistical evidence of interaction with PM2.5 for previous lung function signal, rs10841302, near AEBP2, suggesting increased susceptibility of FEV1/FVC to PM2.5, as copies of the G allele increased (interaction beta: -0.073 percentage points, 95%CI: -0.105, -0.041). There was no observed interaction between air pollutants and the weighted genetic risk score.

We carried out the largest genome-wide gene-air pollution interaction study of lung function and identified effects of clinically relevant size and significance. We observed up to 440ml lower lung function for certain genotypes associated with mean levels of outdoor air pollution at baseline, which is approximately equivalent to nine years of normal loss of lung function.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsLeftover blood samples were selected between February 8 to March 25, 2021, by SYNLAB Estonia from all counties and age groups (0-9, 10-19, 20-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-100 years) proportionally to the whole Estonian population and tested for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (anti-S-RBD IgG) using Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay. Antibody levels after positive PCR-test or vaccination were described by nonlinear model.

ResultsA total of 2517 samples were tested. Overall seroprevalence (95% CI) was 20.1% (18.5-21.7%), similar in all age groups. If all individuals vaccinated with the first dose at least 14 days before antibody measurement were assumed to be seronegative, the overall seroprevalence was 15.8% (14.4-17.3%), 4-fold larger than the proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases. According to nonlinear models, age increased anti-S-RBD IgG production after positive PCR-test but decreased after vaccination. The peak of anti-S-RBD IgG in a 52-year-old (median age of PCR-positive and/or vaccinated individuals) was significantly higher after vaccination compared with positive PCR-test (22082 (12897...26875) vs 6732 (2321...8243) AU/mL), but half-life was similar (26.5 (6.9...46.1) vs 38.3 (8.2...68.5) days).

Dogs can scent-identify the unique odors of the volatile organic compounds generated during infection by interrogating specimens or, ideally, the body of a patient. After training 6 dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 in human respiratory secretions (in vitro scent-detection), we retrained 5 of them to diagnose the infection by scenting the patient directly (in vivo scent-detection). Then, efficacy trials were designed to compare the diagnostic performance of the dogs against that of the rRT-PCR in 848 human subjects: 269 hospitalized patients (COVID-19 prevalence 30.1%), 259 hospital staff (prevalence 2.7%), and 320 government employees (prevalence 1.25%). The limit of detection in vitro was lower than 10-12 copies ssRNA/mL. In vivo, all dogs detected 92 COVID-19 patients present among the 848 study subjects. Detection was immediate, and independent of prevalence, time post-exposure, or presence of symptoms, with 95.2% accuracy and high sensitivity (95.9%; 95% C.I. 93.6-97.4), specificity (95.1%; 94.4-95.8), positive predictive value (69.7%; 65.9-73.2), and negative predictive value (99.5%; 99.2-99.7). To determine real-life performance, we waited 75 days to carry out an effectiveness assay among the riders of the Metro System of Medellin, deploying the human-canine teams without previous training or announcement.

MethodsWe conducted a serologic survey of firefighters in Los Angeles, California, USA, in October 2020. Individuals were classified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 if they tested positive for immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, or both. We compared demographic and contextual factors for seropositivity.

ResultsOf 713 participants, 8.9% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seropositivity was not associated with gender, age, or race/ethnicity. Furthermore, firefighters who worked in zip codes with lower income or higher share of minority population did not have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity was highest among firefighters who reported working in the vicinity of Los Angeles International Airport, which had a known outbreak in July 2020.

ConclusionsSeroprevalence among firefighters was no higher than seroprevalence in the general population, suggesting that workplace safety protocols, such as access to PPE and testing, can mitigate increased risk of infection at work.

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates falls with increasing prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data SourcesClinicalTrials.gov, WHO, McGill and LSHTM trackers of COVID-19 candidate vaccines, peer reviewed publications, and press releases were searched until March 31st, 2021.

Study SelectionAll RCTs reporting efficacy outcomes from Phase 3 trials till March 31st, 2021 were included. Of the 11 vaccine candidates that had started their Phase 3 trials by November 1, 2020. Phase 3 efficacy outcomes were available for 8 vaccine candidates. (PROSPERO CRD42021243121).

Data Extraction and SynthesisBoth authors independently extracted the data required from identified sources, using PRISMA guidelines. The analysis included all RCTs reported in peer reviewed publications and publicly available sources. A random effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimator was used to summarize the treatment effects. Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 infections per protocol in vaccine and placebo groups, risk ratio, prevalence of the COVID-19 infection rate in the populations where the Phase 3 trials were conducted.

Results8 vaccine candidates had reported efficacy data from a total of 20 independent Phase 3 trials, representing a total of 221,968 subjects, 453 infections across the vaccinated groups and 1,554 infections across the placebo groups. The overall estimate of the risk-ratio is 0.24 (95% CI, 0.17-0.34, p < 0.01), with an I2 statistic of 88.73%. The meta-regression analysis with pandemic prevalence as the moderator explains almost half the variance in risk ratios across trials (R2=49.06%, p<0.01).

Conclusion and RelevancePandemic prevalence explains almost half of the between-trial variance in reported efficacies. Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates declines as the pandemic prevalence increases.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic explain the heterogeneity in efficacies reported across Phase 3 trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates?

FindingsAlmost 50% of the variance in efficacies reported across Phase 3 trials can be explained by differences in COVID-19 infection rate prevailing across trials. Efficacy of evaluated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates falls significantly with increasing prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic across trial sites.

Catheter-related infection triggers a strong inflammatory reaction and has been associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The clinical diagnosis of catheter-related infection is made difficult by non-specific symptoms. Investigating the alterations in biochemical parameters related to infectious and inflammatory processes in these patients constitute an active line of research. The aim of this study was to investigate factors influencing the plasma concentration of galectin-3 in catheter-bearing patients and to explore its potential usefulness as an index for catheter-related infections.

MethodsCirculating concentrations of galectin-3, chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were measured in 110 patients with a central venous catheter, 165 patients with a urinary catheter, and 72 control subjects.

ResultsCatheter-bearing patients had significantly higher concentrations of galectin-3 and the other markers than the control group. We identified chronic kidney disease as an independent determinant of plasma galectin-3 concentrations in patients with a central catheter, and serum creatinine concentration, cardiovascular disease and the number of days the catheter was indwelling as determinants in urinary catheter patients. We also found that measuring galectin-3 in urinary catheter patients with a catheter-related infection was more accurate for diagnosis than the other parameters. At galectin-3 = 15 ng/mL, sensitivity was 90%.

ConclusionWe conclude that measurement of galectin-3 concentration may be useful for assessing the inflammatory status of catheter-bearing patients and may contribute to the diagnosis of catheter-related infection in those with a urinary catheter.",NA,medrxiv

Pakistan has one of the world  s largest population, of over 200 million people and is experiencing a severe third wave of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 that begun in March 2021.In Pakistan, during third wave until now only 12 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been collected and among these 9 are from Islamabad. This highlights the need for more genome sequencing to allow surveillance of variants in circulation. In fact more genomes are available among travellers with a travel history from Pakistan, than from within the country itself.

MethodsFor a better understanding of the circulating variants in Lahore and surrounding areas with a combined population of 11.1 million, within a week of April 2021, 102 samples were sequenced. The samples were randomly collected from 2 hospitals with a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cutoff value of less than 25 cycles.

ResultsAnalysis of the lineages shows that B.1.1.7 (first identified in the UK, Alpha variant) dominates, accounting for 97.9% (97/99) of cases, with B.1.351 (first identified in South Africa, Beta variant) accounting for 2.0% (2/99) of cases. No other lineages were observed.

DiscussionIn depth analysis of the B.1.1.7 lineages indicates multiple separate introductions and subsequent establishment within the region. Eight samples were identical to genomes observed in Europe (7 UK, 1 Switzerland), indicating recent transmission. Genomes of other samples show evidence that these have evolved, indicating sustained transmission over a period of time either within Pakistan or other countries with low density genome sequencing. Vaccines remain effective against B.1.1.7, however the low level of B.1.351 against which some vaccines are less effective demonstrates the requirement for continued prospective genomic surveillance.",NA,medrxiv

DesignSystematic review.

Data sourcesThe electronic databases CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Medline, and Embase (OvidSP) were systematically searched from 1st April, 1996 to 4th February, 2021.

Eligibility criteriaThe main inclusion criterion was that the study, using empirical quantitative methods, addressed the effectiveness of PACs.

Data extraction and synthesisTitles, abstracts, and full texts were screened in duplicate by two authors. Risk of bias assessment, using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies, and data extraction were performed by one author and checked by the other author. Results were synthesised narratively owing to the heterogeneity of the included studies.

ResultsSeven prospective controlled studies were conducted. Most studies had a high risk of bias. Three studies reported a significant reduction in the length of the hospital stay, and two studies reported a significant reduction in cancellation of surgery for medical reasons when patients were seen in the PAC. In addition, the included studies presented mixed results regarding anxiety in patients.

ConclusionThis systematic review demonstrated a reduction in the length of hospital stay and cancellation of surgery when the patients had been assessed in the PAC. There is a need for high-quality prospective studies to gain a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of PACs.

Most models assume the transmission rate of a contagion does not vary over time. However, these rates do vary during an epidemic due to environmental conditions, social behaviors, and public-health interventions deployed to control the disease. Therefore, obtaining time-dependent rates can aid in understanding the progression of disease through a population. We derive an analytical expression using a standard SIR-type mathematical model to compute time-dependent transmission rate estimates for an epidemic in terms of either incidence or prevalence type available data. We illustrate applicability of our method by applying data on various public health problems, including infectious diseases (Ebola, SARS, and Leishmaniasis) and social issues (obesity and alcohol drinking) to compute transmission rates over time. We show that transmission rate estimates can have a large variation over time, depending on the type of available data and other epidemiological parameters. Time-dependent estimation of transmission rates captures the dynamics of the problem and can be utilized to understand disease progression through population accurately. Alternatively, constant estimations may provide unacceptable results that could have major public health consequences.",NA,medrxiv

ObjectiveWe examined the temporal association between the county-level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of social vulnerability to disasters, its subcomponents and race/ethnic composition with COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the U.S. in the year starting in March 2020.

MethodsCounties (n=3091) with [&ge;] 50 COVID-19 cases by March 6th, 2021 were included in the study. Associations between SVI (and its subcomponents) and county level racial composition with the incidence and death per capita were assessed by fitting a negative-binomial mixed-effects model. This model was also used to examine potential time varying associations between weekly number of cases/deaths and SVI or racial composition. Data was adjusted for percentage of population aged [&ge;]65 years, state level testing rate, comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score, and environmental factors including average fine particulate matter (PM2.5), temperature and precipitation.

ResultsHigher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was independently associated with higher COVID-19 incidence (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] per-10 percentile increase:1.02, (95% CI 1.02, 1.03, p<0.001), and death per capita (1.04, (95% CI 1.04, 1.05, p<0.001). SVI became an independent predictor of incidence starting from March 2020, but this association became weak or insignificant by the winter, a period that coincided with a sharp increase in infection rates and mortality, and when counties with higher proportion of White residents were disproportionately represented (""third wave""). By Spring of 2021, SVI was again a predictor of COVID-19 outcomes. Counties with greater proportion of Black residents also observed similar temporal trends COVID-19-related adverse outcomes. Counties with greater proportion of Hispanic residents had worse outcomes throughout the duration of the analysis.

ConclusionExcept for the winter ""third wave"" when majority White communities had the highest incidence of cases, counties with greater social vulnerability and proportionately higher minority populations, experienced worse COVID-19 outcomes.

Initially, a wide array of research into this topic was discovered from the past decade, illustrating a keen interest in the potential causal relationship between the gut microbiome and CRC. However, the cancer research community is lacking a summarised systematic review of this kind which aims to explore the evidence linking the human gut microbiome to risk of CRC.

DesignThis systematic review was carried out with two independent reviewers assessing the database outcomes from Medline and EMBASE during May 2020. A meta-analysis was undertaken studying the link between Helicobacter pylori and CRC; processed through Stata.

Results31 papers were included in the systematic review, followed by 12 for the meta-analysis. From these papers, Fusobacterium and Bacteroides were reported most frequently as enriched in CRC versus control. The meta-analysis showed an Odds Ratio of 1.49 (95% CI 1.19 - 1.86), including a total of 20,001 events. This meta-analysis concluded that H. pylori infection significantly increases the risk of CRC, albeit with evidence of publication bias.

ConclusionsBacteria have been discovered to increase the risk of CRC, however a definitive causal relationship cannot be concluded or excluded using case-control studies. To fully understand the potential link of the bacteria listed, alterations in research design and execution are required. The assessment found a need for a large-scale cohort study conducted over a significant period of time to thoroughly evaluate the potential relationship between gut microbiome and CRC risk.

Due to its proximity and close links to China, Southeast Asia was one of the first regions to be affected by the outbreak. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia in the general adult population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in Southeast Asia during the course of the first year of the pandemic.

MethodsSeveral literature databases were systemically searched for articles published up to February 2021 and two reviewers independently evaluated all relevant studies using pre-determined criteria. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis model.

ResultsIn total, 32 samples from 25 studies with 20,352 participants were included. Anxiety was assessed in all 25 studies and depression in 15 studies with pooled prevalence rates of 22% and 16% respectively. Only two studies assessed insomnia, which was estimated at 19%. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was similar amongst frontline HCWs (18%), general HCWs (17%), and students (20%) whilst being noticeably higher in the general population (27%).

ConclusionsThis is the first systematic review to investigate the mental health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in Southeast Asia. A considerable proportion of the general population and HCWs reported mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression; the pooled prevalence rater, however, remain significantly lower than those reported in other areas such as China and Europe.",NA,medrxiv

Childhood sexual abuse is linked to internalising disorders in later life. In older adults, SV occurs more often than previously believed. Moreover, health care workers lack the skills to address SV in later life. Studies researching the mental health impact of lifetime SV, i.e. SV during childhood, adulthood and old age, are lacking.

MethodsBetween July 2019 and March 2020, 513 older adults living in Belgium participated in structured face-to-face-interviews. Selection occurred via a cluster random probability sampling with a random walk finding approach. Depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) were measured using validated scales. Participants were asked about suicide attempts and self-harm during their lifetime and in the past 12-months. SV was measured using behaviourally specific questions based on a broad SV definition.

ResultsRates for depression, anxiety and PTSD were 27%, 26% and 6% respectively, 2% had attempted suicide, 1% reported self-harm in the past 12-months. Over 44% experienced lifetime SV, 8% in the past 12-months. Lifetime SV was linked to depression (p =.001), anxiety (p =.001), and PTSD in participants with a chronic illness/disability (p = .002) or no/lower education (p <.001). We found no link between lifetime SV and suicide attempts or self-harm in the past 12-months.

ConclusionsLifetime SV is linked to mental health problems in late life. Tailored mental health care for older SV victims is necessary. Therefore, capacity building of professionals, and development of clinical guidelines and care procedures are important.",NA,medrxiv

The implemented frequentist design had group sequential boundaries for efficacy and futility interim analyses when 90-days post-randomization was met for 500, 700, 900, and 1,100 patients. The Bayesian alternative utilized predictive probability of trial success to govern early termination for efficacy and futility with a first interim analysis at 500 randomized patients, and subsequent interims after every 100 randomizations.

SettingMulti-center, acute stroke study conducted within a National Institutes of Health neurological emergencies clinical trials network.

ParticipantsPatient level data from 1,151 patients randomized in a clinical trial comparing intensive insulin therapy to standard in acute stroke patients with hyperglycemia.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Sample size at end of study. This was defined as the sample size at which each of the studies stopped accrual of patients.

ResultsAs conducted, the frequentist design passed the futility boundary after 936 participants were randomized. Using the same sequence and timing of randomization and outcome data, the Bayesian alternative crossed the futility boundary about 3 months earlier after 800 participants were randomized.

Conclusions and RelevanceBoth trial designs stopped for futility prior to reaching the planned maximum sample size. In both cases, the clinical community and patients would benefit from learning the answer to the trials primary question earlier. The common feature across the two designs was frequent interim analyses to stop early for efficacy or for futility. Differences between how this was implemented between the two trials resulted in the differences in early stopping.

We hypothesize that a combination of interictal EEG biomarkers, including a novel low frequency marker, can predict mesial temporal involvement and can assist in prognosis related to surgical resections.

MethodsInterictal direct current wide bandwidth invasive EEG recordings from 83 patients implanted with 5,111 electrodes were retrospectively studied. Logistic regression was used to classify electrodes and patient outcomes. A feed-forward neural network was implemented to understand putative mechanisms.

ResultsInterictal infraslow frequency EEG activity was decreased for SOZ electrodes while faster frequencies such as delta (2-4 Hz) and beta-gamma (20-50 Hz) activity were increased. These spectral changes comprised a novel interictal EEG biomarker that was significantly increased for mesial temporal SOZ electrodes compared to non-SOZ electrodes. Interictal EEG biomarkers correctly classified mesial temporal SOZ electrodes with a specificity of 87% and positive predictive value of 80%. These interictal EEG biomarkers also correctly classified patient outcomes after surgical resection with a specificity of 91% and positive predictive value of 87%.

InterpretationInterictal infraslow EEG activity is decreased near the SOZ while higher frequency power is increased, suggesting distinct underlying physiologic mechanisms. Decreased interictal infraslow activity may reflect the loss of neural inhibition. Narrowband interictal EEG power bands provide information about the SOZ and can help predict mesial temporal involvement in seizure onset. Together with interictal epileptiform discharges and high frequency oscillations, these interictal biomarkers may provide prognostic information prior to surgical resection.",NA,medrxiv

A choice-based conjoint experiment was fielded in Hong Kong to examine factors that shape citizens preference toward COVID-19 vaccines and their time preference to be vaccinated, which is overlooked in extant literature. Results suggest people are most concerned about vaccines efficacy and severe side-effects, and that cash incentives are not useful in enhancing vaccine appeal. The majority of respondents show low intention for immediate vaccination, and many of them want to delay their vaccination. Further analysis shows that their time preference is shaped more by respondent characteristics than vaccine attributes. In particular, confidence in the vaccine, trust in government, and working in high-risk professions are associated with earlier timing for vaccine uptake. Meanwhile, forced COVID testing would delay vaccination. The findings offer a novel view in understanding how people decide whether and when to receive new vaccines, which have pivotal implications for a head start of any mass vaccination programs.

This longstanding question for governments around the world is felt acutely in the context of the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics. Many countries have laws and policies that criminalise behaviours, making same-sex relationships, illicit drug use, and sex work illegal. Meanwhile, some countries have enshrined gender- and rights-protective institutions in law. Under the global AIDS strategy of the last five years, national AIDS response efforts in countries have focused on reaching people living with HIV with testing and antiretroviral treatment to suppress the HIV virus, preventing mortality and HIV transmission. At the end of this 5-year push, this article provides an ecological analysis of whether those countries with criminalising legal environments achieved more or less success. In countries where same-sex relationships were fully criminalised, the portion of people living with HIV who knew their status was 11% lower and viral suppression rates were 8% lower. Under sex-work criminalization, the rate of people living with HIV who knew their status was 10% lower and viral suppression 6% lower. Drug use criminalisation was associated with 14% lower knowledge of status and viral. On the other hand in countries with laws advancing non-discrimination, human rights institutions, and gender-based violence response, HIV services indicators were significantly better. This ecological evidence on the relationships between the legal environment and successful HIV response provides support for a strategy that includes a focus on law reform to achieve goals missed in 2020.

Summary BoxO_LICountries around the world, across economic and geographic boundaries, have taken different approaches to the application of criminal law to same-sex sex, sex work, and drug use--with most taking a partially or fully criminalising legal approach in one or more of these areas.
C_LIO_LIIn tackling the AIDS pandemic, globally agreed goals for 2020 focused on ensuring most people living with HIV were aware of their HIV status and had suppressed the HIV virus through effective antiretroviral treatment.
C_LIO_LIThe AIDS response in countries that criminalised was less successful than those that did not--achieving significantly lower levels of HIV status knowledge and HIV viral suppression.
C_LIO_LICountries with clear laws advancing non-discrimination, human rights institutions, and gender-based violence response had better knowledge of HIV status and viral suppression rates.
C_LIO_LIThis analysis suggests a new global AIDS strategy that includes a focus on law reform may hold promise in achieving goals that were missed in 2020.

This retrospective study examined if, and to what degree, a relationship exists between pre-infection serum vitamin D levels and disease severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-19.

Design and patientsThe records of individuals admitted between April 7th, 2020 and February 4th, 2021 to the Galilee Medical Center (GMC) in Nahariya, Israel with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were searched for vitamin D (VitD) levels measured 14 to 730 days prior to the positive PCR test.

MeasurementsPatients admitted to GMC with COVID-19 were categorized according to disease severity and VitD level. Association between pre-infection VitD levels and COVID-19 severity was ascertained utilizing a multivariate regression analysis.

ResultsOf 1176 patients admitted, 253 had VitD levels prior to COVID-19 infection. Compared with mildly or moderately diseased patients, those with severe or critical COVID-19 disease were more likely to have pre-infection vitamin D deficiency of less than 20 ng/mL (OR=14.30, 95%, 4.01-50.9; p < .001); be older (OR=1.039 for each year, 95% CI for OR, 1.017-1.061; p< .01), and have diabetes (OR=2.031, 95% CI for OR, 1.04-3.36; p= 0.038).

We aimed to describe how health and demographic factors have been associated with excess mortality during the pandemic.

DesignTime-series analysis.

SettingUK primary care data from practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink on July 31st 2020.

ParticipantsWe constructed a time-series dataset including 9,635,613 adults ([&ge;]40 years old) who were actively registered at the general practice during the study period.

Main outcome measuresWe extracted weekly numbers of deaths between March 2015 and July 2020, stratified by individual-level factors. Excess mortality during wave 1 of the UK pandemic (5th March to 27th May 2020) compared to pre-pandemic was estimated using seasonally adjusted negative binomial regression models. Relative rates of death for a range of factors were estimated before and during wave 1 by including interaction terms.

ResultsAll-cause mortality increased by 43% (95% CI 40%-47%) during wave 1 compared with pre-pandemic. Changes to the relative rate of death associated with most socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were small during wave 1 compared with pre-pandemic. However, the mortality rate associated with dementia markedly increased (RR for dementia vs no dementia pre-pandemic: 3.5, 95% CI 3.4-3.5; RR during wave 1: 5.1, 4.87-5.28); a similar pattern was seen for learning disabilities (RR pre-pandemic: 3.6, 3.4-3.5; during wave 1: 4.8, 4.4-5.3), for Black or South Asian ethnicity compared to white, and for London compared to other regions.

ConclusionsThe first UK COVID-19 wave appeared to amplify baseline mortality risk by a relatively constant factor for most population subgroups. However disproportionate increases in mortality were seen for those with dementia, learning disabilities, non-white ethnicity, or living in London.

Summary boxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAll-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic was higher than in previous years; this excess mortality was particularly pronounced among elderly people, males, people of non-white ethnicity, people of lower socio-economic status and people living in care-homes.

We specified a hierarchical spatiotemporal model, using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations of the integrated nested Laplace approximations approximation. This approach allowed us to spatially predict, in the territory of Catalonia (Spain), the levels of the four pollutants for which there is the most evidence of an adverse health effect.

Our model allowed us to make fairly accurate spatial predictions of both long- term and short-term exposure to air pollutants, with a low computational cost. The only requirements of the method we propose are the minimum number of stations distributed throughout the territory where the predictions are to be made, and that the spatial and temporal dimensions are either independent or separable.

HighlightsWe show a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal model.

Our model provides predictions of both long-term and short-term exposure.

The computational cost is low.

The model only needs a minimum number of stations being distributed throughout the territory.

The other requirement of our model is that the spatial and temporal dimensions are either independent or separable.

Methods136 consecutive patients with rheumatic diseases who never had a diagnosis of COVID-19 previously, and had completed vaccination with either the ChAdOx1 or BBV152 vaccines were recruited. Their IgG antibody titres to the Spike protein were estimated 1 month after the second dose.

Results102 patients had AIRD while the 34 had non-AIRD. Lesser patients with AIRD (92/102) had positive antibodies titres than ones with non-AIRD(33/34) [p<0.001]. Amongst patients who received the ChAdOX1 vaccine, the AIRD group had lower antibody titres. Although the AIRD patients receiving BBV152 had similarly lower titres numerically, this did not attain statistical significance probably due to lesser numbers. Comparing the two vaccines, 114(95%) of those who received ChAdOx1 (n=120) and 11(68.7%) of those who received BBV152(n=16) had detectable antibodies [p=0.004]. Antibody titres also were higher in ChAdOx1 recipients when compared to BBV152.

To validate the findings, we estimated antibody titres in 30 healthy people each who had received either vaccine. All 30 who had received ChAdOX1 and only 23/30 of those who had received BBV152 had positive antibodies (p=0.011).

ConclusionIn this preliminary analysis, patients with AIRD had lower seroconversion rates as well as lower antibody titres as compared to patients with non-AIRD. Also,the humoral immunogenicity of the BBV152 vaccine appears to be less than that of the ChAdOX1 vaccine.

The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines by investigating the spatiotemporal trends of their sentiment and emotion towards vaccines, as well as how such trends relate to popular topics on Twitter in the US.

MethodsWe collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the US from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified three phases along the pandemic timeline with the significant changes of public sentiment and emotion, further linking to eleven key events and major topics as the potential drivers to induce such changes via cloud mapping of keywords and topic modelling.

ResultsAn increasing trend of positive sentiment in parallel with the decrease of negative sentiment are generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards vaccines. The overall tendency of the eight types of emotion implies the trustiness and anticipation of the public to vaccination, accompanied by the mixture of fear, sadness and anger. Critical social/international events and/or the announcements of political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on the public opinion on vaccines. These factors, along with important topics and manual reading of popular posts on eleven key events, help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis.

ConclusionsThe analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics and promote the confidence of individuals within a certain region or community, towards vaccines.",NA,medrxiv

Its aetiology is unclear, and it often follows a mild acute illness. Anecdotal reports of gradual clinical responses to histamine receptor antagonists (HRA) suggest a histamine-dependent mechanism distinct from anaphylaxis. Histamine is a paracrine regulator of T-cells: although T-cell perturbations are reported in acute COVID-19, the T-cell landscape in recovered patients and its relationship to long-COVID remains under-explored.

ObjectiveTo survey T-cell populations in patients recovered from mild COVID-19, comparing those with long-COVID and asymptomatic individuals, and to analyse these data in light of symptoms and response to HRA.

DesignProspective observational cohort study.

SettingSingle-site outpatient clinic

Participants65 (87 to 408 days post mild COVID-19). None had sought treatment for acute COVID-19. 16 recovered uneventfully (asymptomatic group), 49 presented with long-COVID (symptomatic group), of whom 25 received HRA.

MeasurementsStructured long-COVID symptom questionnaire; quantification of T-cell subsets using a standard diagnostic assay.

ResultsHRA significantly reduced mean symptom burden. T-cell profiles distinguished asymptomatic and long-COVID groups, but did not predict response to HRA. Long-COVID patients had reduced CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory (EM) cells and increased PD-1 expression on central memory (CM) cells. Asymptomatic controls had reduced CD8+ EM cells and increased CD28 expression on CM cells.

ConclusionHRA reduce long-COVID symptoms. T-cell perturbations persist for up to 400 days following mild acute COVID-19 irrespective of long-COVID symptoms.

We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Enclave, a harmonized electronic health record (EHR) dataset of 5.9 million nationally-representative, diverse, and gender-balanced patients, to describe outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis with SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe identified all chronic liver diseases patients with and without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing documented in the N3C Data Enclave as of data release date 5/15/2021. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Survival analysis methods were used to estimate cumulative incidences of death, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation, and to calculate the associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and demographic and clinical factors to 30-day mortality.

ResultsWe isolated 217,143 patients with CLD: 129,097 (59%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, 25,844 (12%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive, 54,065 (25%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, and 8,137 (4%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive. Among CLD patients without cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 0.4% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 1.8% in positive patients. Among CLD patients with cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 4.0% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 9.7% in positive patients.

Compared to those who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with more than two-fold (aHR 2.43, 95% CI 2.23-2.64) hazard of death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis. Compared to patients without cirrhosis, the presence of cirrhosis was associated with a three-fold (aHR 3.39, 95% CI 2.96-3.89) hazard of death at 30 days among patients who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. Age (aHR 1.03 per year, 95% CI 1.03-1.04) was associated with death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis who were SARS-CoV-2 positive.

ConclusionsIn this study of nearly 220,000 CLD patients, we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.43-times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among CLD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were associated with 3.39-times mortality hazard. Compared to previous studies, our use of a nationally-representative, diverse, and gender-balanced dataset enables wide generalizability of these findings.",NA,medrxiv

However, response is highly variable and possible genetic underpinnings of this variability remain unknown. Here, we performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to estimate the amount of variance in symptom severity among clozapine-treated patients explained by PRSs (R2) and examined the association between symptom severity and genotype-predicted CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 enzyme activity. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed to explore loci associated with symptom severity. A multicenter cohort of 804 patients (after quality control N=684) with schizophrenia spectrum disorder treated with clozapine were cross-sectionally assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and/or the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale. GWA and PRS regression analyses were conducted. Genotype-predicted CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 enzyme activities were calculated. Schizophrenia-PRS was most significantly and positively associated with low symptom severity (p=1.03x10-3; R2=1.85). Cross disorder-PRS was also positively associated with lower CGI-S score (p=0.01; R2=0.81). Compared to the lowest tertile, patients in the highest schizophrenia-PRS tertile had 1.94 times (p=6.84x10-4) increased probability of low symptom severity. Higher genotype-predicted CYP2C19 enzyme activity was independently associated with lower symptom severity (p=8.44x10-3). While no locus surpassed the genome-wide significance threshold, rs1923778 within NFIB showed a suggestive association (p=3.78x10-7) with symptom severity. We show that high schizophrenia-PRS and genotype-predicted CYP2C19 enzyme activity are independently associated with lower symptom severity among individuals treated with clozapine. Our findings open avenues for future pharmacogenomic projects investigating the potential of PRS and genotype-predicted CYP activity in schizophrenia.",NA,medrxiv

The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), formed from homo- or hetero-tetramers of the IP3R isoforms 1-3, amplifies lymphocyte signaling by releasing Ca2+ from ER stores into the cytosol following antigen-stimulation. While knockout of all 3 IP3R isoforms results in immunodeficiency in mice, the seeming redundancy of subunits was thought to explain the absence of IP3R mutation as a cause of human immunodeficiency. Here, we identify compound heterozygous variants in ITPR3 in two unrelated Caucasian patients presenting with combined immunodeficiency, in one case requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We observed disrupted Calcium homeostasis in patient-derived fibroblasts and immune cells, with abnormal proliferation and activation responses following B and T cell receptor stimulation. Reconstitution of IP3R knockout cell lines identified the variants as functional hypomorphs with reduced discrimination between homeostatic and induced states, validating a link between genotype and phenotype. These results demonstrate a functional linkage between defective ER Ca2+ channels and immunodeficiency, and identify IP3Rs as diagnostic targets for patients with specific inborn errors of immunity.",NA,medrxiv

We have used a novel `gene signature-based drug repositioning strategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to prioritize the FDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis of three independent studies which were based on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in primary human airway epithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately regulate general anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database, extracted from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with information on COVID-19 pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidates for repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibit targets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19 targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications. Finally, these drug targets were computationally prioritized based on gene ranking algorithms, which revealed CXCL10 as the common and strongest candidate with 2 existing drugs.

When a number of studies have emphasized the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and resistance in humans, little attention has been paid to the veterinary sector. The aim of this study was to understand the KAP towards antibiotic use and resistance among the veterinarians in Bangladesh.

MethodsA cross-sectional online based questionnaire survey was conducted from August to September 2020 among the registered veterinary practitioners. A self-administered Google form questionnaire consists of 46 questions on knowledge, attitude and practice regarding antibiotic use and their resistance.

ResultsA total of 208 registered veterinarians participated in this study. 85.1% of the participants were male and 55% of the participants had a Masters degree. Around 50% of the veterinarians were poultry practitioners. All respondents were familiar with antimicrobials. 91.35% of the participants knew that antibiotics can not cure viral infections while 97.6% believed that frequent antibiotic prescription rendered them less effective. Participants claimed that only they are eligible to prescribe drugs for the treatment of animals. Of the total participants, 87.02% believed that a local antimicrobial guideline would be more effective than an international one while around 80% disagreed with adding antibiotics with feed/water as a growth promoter in livestock. However, gaps in practices were highlighted, suggesting training deficiencies.

ConclusionThe study for the first time conducted in Bangladesh dictates the future interventions like courses, workshops, and seminars on antibiotic usage and resistance are needed to ameliorate the awareness and change the behavior of veterinarians with regards to the rational use of antibiotics while also considering individual motivations and justifications for using antibiotics.",NA,medrxiv

Various combination antivirals have been tried.

MethodsA single-center, open-label, parallel-arm, stratified randomized controlled trial evaluated the therapeutic potential of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir in combination with ribavirin in COVID-19. Enrolled patients in severe category were randomized into three groups: A: standard treatment, B: hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin+standard treatment, or C: lopinavir+ritonavir+ribavirin+standard treatment; while non-severe category into two groups: A: standard treatment or B: hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin. Combination antivirals was given for 10 days and followed for 28 days. The primary endpoints were safety, symptomatic and laboratory recovery of organ dysfunctions, and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative report.

ResultsTotal 111 patients randomized: 24, 23, and 24 in severe category A, B, and C respectively, and 20 in each non-severe group. Two patients receiving ribavirin experienced drug induced liver injury and another developed QT prolongation after hydroxychloroquine. In the severe category, 47.6%, 55%, and 30.09% in A, B, and C groups respectively showed symptomatic recovery compared to 93.3% and 86.7% in A and B groups respectively in the non-severe category at 72hrs (P>0.05).

ConclusionsThe results failed to show statistical superiority of the antiviral combination therapies to that of the standard therapy in both the severe and non-severe categories in symptomatic adult patients of COVID-19. However, results do indicate the benefit of non-standard interventional combination therapy in severe disease. Furthermore, the dose of ribavirin needs to be reconsidered in the Indian population.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adults were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either usual standard of care plus 150mg aspirin once daily until discharge or usual standard of care alone using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 01 November 2020 and 21 March 2021, 7351 patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin and 7541 patients to receive usual care alone. Overall, 1222 (17%) patients allocated to aspirin and 1299 (17%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0{middle dot}96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}89-1{middle dot}04; p=0{middle dot}35). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. Patients allocated to aspirin had a slightly shorter duration of hospitalisation (median 8 vs. 9 days) and a higher proportion were discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (75% vs. 74%; rate ratio 1{middle dot}06; 95% CI 1{middle dot}02-1{middle dot}10; p=0{middle dot}0062). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 22%; risk ratio 0{middle dot}96; 95% CI 0{middle dot}90-1{middle dot}03; p=0{middle dot}23). Aspirin use was associated with an absolute reduction in thrombotic events of 0.6% (SE 0.4%) and an absolute increase in major bleeding events of 0.6% (SE 0.2%).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, aspirin was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality or in the risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death but was associated with a small increase in the rate of being discharged alive within 28 days.

The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon by exploring the individual experiences of women who reported mistreatment during childbirth in Switzerland.

Materials and MethodsThis project used a mixed methods approach to investigate womens experiences of mistreatment during childbirth in general and informal coercion specifically: the present qualitative study expands on the findings from a nationwide online survey on childbirth experience. It combines inductive with theory-guided thematic analysis to study the 7753 comments women wrote in the survey and the subsequent interviews with 11 women who reported being mistreated during childbirth.

ResultsThe women described a wide range of experiences of mistreatment during childbirth in both the survey comments and the interviews. Out of all survey participants who wrote at least one comment (n = 3547), 28% described one or more experiences of mistreatment. Six of the seven types of mistreatment listed in Bohren and colleagues typology of mistreatment during childbirth were found, the most frequent of which were ineffective communication and lack of informed consent. Five further themes were identified in the interviews: informal coercion, risk factors for mistreatment, consequences of mistreatment, examples of good care, and whats needed to improve maternity care.

ConclusionThe findings from this study show that experiences of mistreatment are a reality in Swiss maternity care and give insight into womens individual experiences as well as how these affect them during and after childbirth. This study emphasises the need to respect womens autonomy in order to prevent mistreatment and empower women to actively participate in decisions.

Partner notification (PN) to identify, test and treat sex partners of MSM with bacterial STIs is challenging because MSM often report larger numbers of sex partners and a higher proportion of one-off partners who may be difficult to engage. However, one-off partners contribute disproportionately to onward transmission. Economic research on PN has typically focused on heterosexual people and evidence of effectiveness of PN in MSM is scant. We conducted a systematic review of economic studies of PN interventions in MSM to inform the development of a novel PN intervention for MSM with one-off partners.

MethodSix electronic databases were searched up to June 2020. Cost studies and full economic evaluations, which focused on PN and/or testing and treatment (in the context of PN) of sex partners of MSM with STIs, and/or HIV, were included. A two-stage categorisation process was used for study selection and a narrative synthesis was reported.

ResultsTwenty-six studies of a possible 1909 met the selection criteria. Sixteen focused on MSM but only three of these were on PN. Few studies reported on patients characteristics and settings. Most studies were cost-utility analyses with outcomes reported as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) which were derived from studies on heterosexual people.

ConclusionsNone of the identified studies specifically addressed cost-effectiveness of PN in MSM. The few studies identified as potentially relevant relied on costs and QALYs data from studies in heterosexual people, which may be inappropriate given the different patterns of sexual partnerships reported by these two groups. The lack of evidence on efficient PN approaches for MSM, a group with a high burden of infection, supports the need for new interventions tailored to the needs and preferences of MSM with parallel economic evaluation.",NA,medrxiv

HRQoL information was collected by a generic preference-based tool with five domains (EQ-5D), and summarized into a single score (range 0-1) which represents health utility. We employed multivariable beta regression models to identify determinants of HRQoL and to estimate subgroup-specific HRQoL score.

FindingsOf 1363 individuals (mean age: 32.4 years; mean HRQoL score: 0.857) in our analysis, 62.6% used drugs, 61.3% experienced physical or sexual violence, and 64.6% self-reported taking antiretroviral treatment (ART). The following were associated with a reduction in the average marginal HRQoL score: older age (per decade: 0.018 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.008, 0.027]), drug use (0.022 [0.007, 0.036]), experience of violence (0.024 [0.010, 0.038]), and moderate (vs. no) level of internalized stigma (0.023 [0.004, 0.041]). Current ART use was associated with a 0.015-point (-0.001, 0.031) increase in the HRQoL score. The estimated mean (95%CI) HRQoL scores ranged from 0.838 (0.816, 0.860) for FSW who used drugs, experienced violence, and were not on ART; to 0.899 (0.883, 0.916) for FSW who did not use drugs nor experience violence and were on ART.

InterpretationThese results demonstrate the association of ART with higher HRQoL among FSW and the need to further address structural risks including drug use, violence, and stigma. Population-specific estimates of HRQoL score can be further used to calculate quality-adjusted life years in economic evaluations of individual and structural interventions addressing the needs of FSW living with HIV.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on April 9, 2021 for studies published in English that examined the health-related quality of life of female sex workers (FSW) living with HIV. We used the search terms (""quality of life"") AND (""sex workers"") AND (""HIV""). Our search resulted in a total of 14 studies. We excluded 6 studies as their study sample did not include female sex workers; and another 2 studies as they were mathematical modeling or cost-effectiveness analyses which did not include original data. Of the remaining 6 studies, 5 were among FSW in general, regardless of their HIV status; we only identified one study that specifically examined the quality of life in FSW living with HIV: among 98 HIV-positive women who were former commercial sex workers in Nepal, the authors examined the degree to which indicators of physical, mental, and social domains explained variation in overall perceived life satisfaction. Of the 5 studies among FSW in general, 3 were qualitative studies, one was a quantitative individual-level study, and one was a systematic review and meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of eight studies (China, India, Korea, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Armenia, and the United States) published before July 2013 found that increased psychological health conditions were associated with increased HIV risk behavior. By searching citations of the above systematic review, we identified another more recent meta-analysis which examined the prevalence and risk factors of mental health conditions among FSW in low and middle income countries. This meta-analysis included 56 unique studies published up to April 2020, demonstrating prevalent mental health conditions among FSW in low- and middle-income settings, with increased burden of mental health conditions associated with experiences of violence, harmful alcohol and drug use, inconsistent condom use, and HIV incidence. In summary, although mental health conditions of FSW have been broadly explored in the literature, there remains a dearth of research which evaluated health-related quality of life of FSW living with HIV.

Added value of this studyWe directly evaluated the HRQoL of FSW living with HIV in South Africa. We used data on a sample of FSW who were diagnosed with HIV and enrolled into a randomized trial via a local sex worker program in Durban. Our comprehensive baseline questionnaire allowed us to examine a range of factors (sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features and treatment of HIV, drug use and other social and structural factors) and their relationship with HRQoL among FSW living with HIV. The average HRQoL score was 0.857 for FSW living with HIV. We identified older age, lack of ART use, drug use, and experience of violence as being associated with a lower HRQoL score among FSW living with HIV. We did not find an independent association between CD4 count or viral load with HRQoL score after adjusting for current ART use and other covariates. In addition, we derived overall and subgroup-specific estimates of HRQoL scores, representing health utilities, which can be used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years in cost utility analysis for economic evaluations of interventions targeting FSW living with HIV in South Africa.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe findings here reinforce the importance of comprehensive programs to optimize treatment outcomes among sex workers living with HIV.

Cross-neutralizing activity against major variants of concern (B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351) has been observed following vaccination, albeit at a reduced potency, but whether vaccines based on the Spike glycoprotein of these viral variants will produce a superior cross-neutralizing antibody response has not been fully investigated. Here, we used sera from individuals infected in wave 1 in the UK to study the long-term cross-neutralization up to 10 months post onset of symptoms (POS), as well as sera from individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 variant to compare cross-neutralizing activity profiles. We show that neutralizing antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity can be detected from wave 1 up to 10 months POS. Although neutralization of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 is lower, the difference in neutralization potency decreases at later timepoints suggesting continued antibody maturation and improved tolerance to Spike mutations. Interestingly, we found that B.1.1.7 infection also generates a cross-neutralizing antibody response, which, although still less potent against B.1.351, can neutralize parental wave 1 virus to a similar degree as B.1.1.7.

Evidence of neutrophil dysfunction in COVID-19 is based predominantly on transcriptomics or single functional assays. Cell functions are interwoven pathways, and so understanding the effect of COVID-19 across the spectrum of neutrophil function may identify tractable therapeutic targets.

ObjectivesExamine neutrophil phenotype and functional capacity in COVID-19 patients versus age-matched controls (AMC)

MethodsIsolated neutrophils from 41 hospitalised, non-ICU COVID-19 patients and 23 AMC underwent ex vivo analyses for migration, bacterial phagocytosis, ROS generation, NET formation (NETosis) and cell surface receptor expression. DNAse 1 activity was measured, alongside circulating levels of cfDNA, MPO, VEGF, IL-6 and sTNFRI. All measurements were correlated to clinical outcome. Serial sampling on day 3-5 post hospitalisation were also measured.

ResultsCompared to AMC, COVID-19 neutrophils demonstrated elevated transmigration (p=0.0397) and NETosis (p=0.0366), but impaired phagocytosis (p=0.0236) associated with impaired ROS generation (p<0.0001). Surface expression of CD54 (p<0.0001) and CD11c (p=0.0008) was significantly increased and CD11b significantly decreased (p=0.0229) on COVID-19 patient neutrophils. COVID-19 patients showed increased systemic markers of NETosis including increased cfDNA (p=0.0153) and impaired DNAse activity (p<0.0.001). MPO (p<0.0001), VEGF (p<0.0001), TNFRI (p<0.0001) and IL-6 (p=0.009) were elevated in COVID-19, which positively correlated with disease severity by 4C score.

ConclusionCOVID-19 is associated with neutrophil dysfunction across all main effector functions, with altered phenotype, elevated migration, impaired antimicrobial responses and elevated NETosis. These changes represent a clear mechanism for tissue damage and highlight that targeting neutrophil function may help modulate COVID-19 severity.",NA,medrxiv

Out of 10 PRM tested, the long pentraxin PTX3 and Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) bound the viral Nucleoprotein and Spike, respectively. MBL bound trimeric Spike, including that of variants of concern, in a glycan- dependent way and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in three in vitro models. Moreover, upon binding to Spike, MBL activated the lectin pathway of complement activation. Genetic polymorphisms at the MBL locus were associated with disease severity.

There are significant hurdles to formal diagnosis with endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac MRI whether by resource limitations, patient instability, or isolation precautions. Therefore, further exploratory analysis is needed to clinically define the characteristics and spectrum of severity of COVID-19 myocarditis.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to describe the clinical course, echocardiographic, and laboratory testing across suspected fulminant and non-fulminant clinically defined COVID-19 myocarditis.

MethodsIn a cross-sectional observational study of 19 patients with clinically defined COVID-19 myocarditis, we report presenting symptoms, clinical course, laboratory findings, and echocardiographic results stratified by non-fulminant and fulminant myocarditis. Student t-test and univariate logistic regression are used to compare laboratory findings across fulminant and non-fulminant cases.

FindingsAmong 19 patients, there was no prior history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure; 21.1% of patients died; and 78.9% of cases required supplemental oxygen. A significantly higher geometric mean D-dimer and ferritin were observed in patients with fulminant compared to non-fulminant suspected myocarditis. 26.3% of cases had pericardial effusions. 10 out of the 16 with available echocardiographic data had normal left ventricular systolic function.

ConclusionsIn this cross-sectional analysis, we provide a practical clinical depiction of patients with clinical COVID-19 myocarditis across fulminant and non-fulminant cases. Statistically significant elevations in inflammatory markers in fulminant versus non-fulminant cases generate hypothesis regarding the role of systemic inflammation in driving severity of COVID-19 myocarditis.",NA,medrxiv

Whether this is a causal relationship or explained by prior vulnerability that influences the risk of both depression and IPVA is not known.

Methods and FindingsWe analysed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children prospective cohort (N=1,764 women, 1,028 men). To assess the causal association between IPVA at 18-21 years old and logged depressive symptom scores at age 23, we used: i) multivariable linear regression, ii) inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and iii) difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, which compared the mean change in logged depressive symptom scores between ages 16 and 23 between those who experienced IPVA and those who did not.

Women who experienced IPVA had on average 26% higher depressive symptom score after adjustment for measured confounders (ratio of geometric means 1.26, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.40). In men, the difference was 5% (ratio of geometric means 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.21). Results from IPTW analysis were similar. In the DID analysis, there was no evidence that being exposed to IPVA affected the change in depressive symptom scores over time compared to being in the non-exposed group for either women (difference-in-differences: 1%, -12% to 16%) or men (-1%, -19% to 20%).

ConclusionsMultivariable linear regression and IPTW suggested an association between IPVA and higher depressive symptom score in women but not men, but DID analysis indicated a null effect in both women and men. This suggests the causal origins of higher depressive symptoms in this young adult population are likely to reflect prior vulnerability that leads to both higher depressive symptoms and increased risk of IPVA exposure.

Key messagesO_LIWomen and, to a lesser degree, men who experience IPVA between the ages of 18-21 years old tend to have higher levels of depressive symptoms at age 23 years than people who do not.
C_LIO_LIIn women, the association between IPVA and higher depressive symptoms remained after adjustment for measured confounders or use of inverse probability of treatment weighting, whereas in men, the association attenuated to the null after adjustment for measured confounders or use of inverse probability of treatment weighting.
C_LIO_LIHowever, the change in depressive symptoms between ages 16 and 23 years was the same in people who experience IPVA and people who did not, for both women and men. This suggests that the higher levels of depressive symptoms in people who experience IPVA is likely to be driven by prior vulnerability that affects the risk of both IPVA exposure and depressive symptoms, highlighting that IPVA is one of a series of challenges being navigated by psychologically vulnerable young adults.

Our aim was to investigate associations between furlough and diet, physical activity, and sleep during the early stages of the pandemic.

MethodsWe analysed data from 25,092 participants aged 16 to 66 years from eight UK longitudinal studies. Changes in employment (including being furloughed) were defined by comparing employment status pre- and during the first lockdown. Health behaviours included fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and sleeping patterns. Study-specific estimates obtained using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and pre-pandemic health and health behaviours, were statistically pooled. Associations were also stratified by sex, age, and education.

FindingsAcross studies, between 8 and 25% of participants were furloughed. Compared to those who remained working, furloughed workers were slightly less likely to be physically inactive (RRR:0.85, [0.75-0.97], I2=58.7%) and did not differ in diet and sleep behaviours. In stratified analyses, furlough was associated with low fruit and vegetable consumption among males (RRR=1.11; 95%CI: 1.01-1.22; I2: 0%) but not females (RRR=0.84; 95%CI: 0.68-1.04; I2: 65%). Considering change in behaviour, furloughed workers were more likely than those who remained working to report increased fruit and vegetable consumption, exercise, and hours of sleep.

InterpretationThose furloughed exhibited broadly similar levels of health behaviours with those who remained in employment during the initial stages of the pandemic. Social protection policies in the post-pandemic recovery period and during future economic crises may help protect population health.

Data collection was conducted using multiple-cluster sampling method and through household survey. Qualitative part was conducted in the city of Allada, one of the Fon cultural capitals. The participants were purposively selected.

OutcomesContraceptive prevalence rate, unmet need for modern method, and percentage of demand satisfied by a modern method for currently married and sexually active unmarried women were measured in the quantitative part. Access barriers and utilization of modern methods were assessed in the qualitative part.

ResultsOverall, 8.5% (95%CI: 7.7-9.5%) among young women ages 15 to 24 were using modern contraceptives and 13% (95%CI: 12.1-14.0%) among women ages 25 or more. Women 15-24 had a higher unmet need, and a lower demand satisfied by modern contraceptive methods compared to women aged 25 or more. 60.8% (56.9-64.7%) of all unmarried young women had unmet need for modern contraceptives. Young women were more likely to use male condoms which they obtain mainly from for-profit outlets, pharmacies, and relatives. The factors associated with demand satisfied by a modern method were literacy, being unmarried, knowing a greater number of modern contraceptive methods, and experiencing barriers in access to health services. On the other hand, the qualitative study found that barriers to using modern methods include community norms about pre-marital sexual intercourse, perceptions about young womens fertility, spousal consent, and the use of non-modern contraceptives.

ConclusionContraceptive use is low among young women in Benin. The use of modern contraceptives is influenced by socio-demographic factors and social norms. Appropriate interventions might promote comprehensive sexuality education, increase community engagement, provide youth-friendly services, and address gender inequalities.

We find that the different models produce very similar patterns of weekly excess deaths but disagree substantially on the level of excess. While the exact country ranking along percent excess death in 2020 is sensitive to the choice of model the top and bottom ranks are robustly identified. On the country level, the 5-year average death rate model tends to produce the lowest excess death estimates, whereas high excess deaths are produced by the popular 5-year average death count and Euromomo-style Serfling models.

How intrinsic properties of the brain, such as anatomical connectivity, local cell type distribution and gene expression combine to determine the pattern of disease progression remains unknown. One hypothesis proposes that the disease stems from prion-like propagation of misfolded alpha-synuclein via the connectome that might cause varying degrees of tissue damage based on local properties.

Here we used MRI data from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to test this model by mapping the progression of brain atrophy over one, two and four years and relating it to brain structural and functional connectivity, cell type expression and gene ontology enrichment analyses. In this longitudinal study, we derived atrophy progression maps for the three time points using deformation-based morphometry applied to T1-weighted MRI from 74 de novo Parkinsons Disease patients (50 Men: 24 Women) and 157 healthy control participants (115 Men: 42 Women). After regressing out the expected age and sex effects associated with normal aging, we found that atrophy significantly progressed over two and four years in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and the temporal, parietal, occipital and posterior cingulate cortex. This progression was shaped by both structural and functional brain connectivity. Also, the progression of atrophy was more pronounced in regions with a higher expression of genes related to synapses and was related to the prevalence of oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells.

In sum, we demonstrate that the progression of atrophy in Parkinsons Disease is in line with the prion-like propagation hypothesis of alpha-synuclein and provide evidence that synapses may be especially vulnerable to synucleinopathy. In addition to identifying vulnerable brain regions, this study reveals different factors that may be implicated in the neurotoxic mechanisms leading to progression in Parkinsons Disease.",NA,medrxiv

We hypothesized that a community-centered vaccination strategy that included mobilization, vaccination, and ""activation"" components could successfully reach an underserved Latinx population, utilizing its social networks to boost vaccination coverage.

Methods and FindingsOur community-academic-public health partnership, ""Unidos en Salud,"" utilized a theory-informed approach to design our ""Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate"" COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our strategys design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco. We evaluated our prototype outdoor, ""neighborhood"" vaccination program located in a central commercial and transport hub in the Mission District in San Francisco, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework during a 16-week period from February 1, 2021 to May 19, 2021. Programmatic data, city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May 2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients [&ge;]16 years old were used in the evaluation.

There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32-56) years, 53.9% were male and 70.5% were Latinx, 14.1% white, 7.7% Asian, 2.4% Black, and 5.3% other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than $50,000 a year (76.1% vs. 33.5%), be a first-generation immigrant (60.2% vs. 30.1%), not have health insurance (47.3% vs. 16.0%), and not have access to primary care provider (62.4% vs. 36.2%). The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6%), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9%) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1%); approximately 99% reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3% of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4% of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7% said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3% of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6% knew [&ge;]3). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n=729), 91.0% said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6% reached out to [&ge;]3) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0% of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9% who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence.

Our Extended IIC (EIIC) is a type of contrastive learning; however, unlike the original IIC, it is characterized by supervised learning with labeled data pairs, but without the need for a data augmentation technique. Each site in LOSO-CV is left out in turn from the remaining sites used for training and receives a value for modeling evaluation. We applied the EIIC to the resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging dataset of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. The challenging nature of brain analysis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be attributed to the variability of subjects, particularly the rapid change in the neural system of children as the target ASD age group. However, EIIC demonstrated higher LOSO-CV classification accuracy for the majority of scanning locations than previously used methods. Particularly, with the adjustment of a mini-batch size, EIIC outperformed other classifiers with an accuracy >0.8 for the sites with highest mean age of the subjects. Considering its effectiveness, our proposed method might be promising for harmonization in other domains, owing to its simplicity and intrinsic flexibility.

However, there is still an incomplete penetrance in the carriers of rare variants associated with Parkinsons disease. To address this issue, we investigated whether a PRS calculated from significant GWAS SNPs affects the penetrance of Parkinsons disease among carriers of rare monogenic variants in known Parkinsons disease genes and those with a family history.

MethodsWe calculated the PRS based on common variants and selected the carriers of rare monogenic variants by using the exome data from UK Biobank. Individuals were divided into three risk categories based on PRS: low (<10%), intermediate (10%-90%), and high (>90%) risk groups. We then compared how PRS affects Parkinsons disease risk among carriers of rare monogenic variants and those with family-history.

ResultsWe observed a two-fold higher odds ratio for a carrier of a monogenic variant that had a high PRS (OR 4.07,95% CI, 1.72-8.08) compared to carriers with a low PRS (OR 1.91, 95% CI, 0.31-6.05). In the same line, carriers with a first-degree family history and with >90% PRS have even a higher risk of developing PD (OR 23.53, 95%CI 5.39-71.54) compared to those with <90% PRS (OR 9.54, 95% CI 3.32-21.65).

ConclusionsOur results show that PRS, carrier status, and family history contribute independently and additively to the Parkinsons disease risk.",NA,medrxiv

DesignProspective observational cohort study of SOARS and 4C Mortality Score in PREDICT (single site) and multi-site ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium) cohorts.

SettingProtocol-based data collection in UK COVID-19 second wave, between October 2020 and January 2021, from PREDICT and ISARIC cohorts.

Participants1383 from single site PREDICT cohort and 20,595 from multi-site ISARIC cohort.

Main outcome measuresRelevance of SOARS and 4C Mortality Score derived from the COVID-19 first wave, determining in-hospital mortality and safe discharge in the UK COVID-19 second wave.

ResultsData from 1383 patients (median age 67y, IQR 52-82; mortality 24.7%) in the PREDICT and 20,595 patients from the ISARIC (mortality 19.4%) cohorts showed both SOARS and 4C Mortality Score remained relevant despite the B.1.1.7 variant and treatment advances. SOARS had AUC of 0.8 and 0.74, while 4C Mortality Score had an AUC of 0.83 and 0.91 for hospital mortality, in the PREDICT and ISARIC cohorts respectively, therefore effective in evaluating both safe discharge and in-hospital mortality. 19.3% (231/1195, PREDICT cohort) and 16.7% (2550/14992, ISARIC cohort) with a SOARS of 0-1 were potential candidates for home discharge to a virtual hospital (VH) model. SOARS score implementation resulted in low re-admission rates, 11.8% (27/229), and low mortality, 0.9% (2/229), in the VH pathway. Use is still suboptimal to prevent admission, as 8.1% in the PREDICT cohort and 9.5% in the ISARIC cohort were admitted despite SOARS score of 0-1.

ConclusionSOARS and 4C Mortality Score remains valid, providing accurate prognostication despite evolving viral subtype and treatment advances, which have altered mortality. Both scores are easily implemented within urgent care pathways with a scope for admission avoidance. They remain safe and relevant to their purpose, transforming complex clinical presentations into tangible numbers, aiding objective decision making.

Despite worldwide vaccination, social distancing and wearing masks, the spread of the virus is still ongoing. One of the mechanisms how neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) block virus entry into cells encompasses interaction inhibition between the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 specific NAb development can be induced in the blood of cattle. Pregnant cows produce NAbs upon immunization, and antibodies move into the colostrum just before calving. Here we immunized cows with SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) protein in proper adjuvant solutions, followed by one boost with SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein, and purified immunoglobulins from colostrum. We demonstrate that this preparation indeed blocks interaction between the trimeric S protein and ACE2 in different in vitro assays. Moreover, we describe the formulation of purified immunoglobulin preparation into a nasal spray. When administered to human subjects, the formulation persists on the nasal mucosa for at least 4 hours as determined by a clinical study. Therefore, we are presenting a solution that shows great potential to serve as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an additional measure to vaccination and wearing masks. Moreover, our technology allows for a rapid and versatile adaption for preparing prophylactic treatments against other diseases by using the defined characteristics of antibody movement into the colostrum.

SignificanceSARS-CoV-2 infections continue to be a high-risk factor for mankind. Antibodies with the potential to neutralize the virus and thus its entry into the host cell have been shown to impose a potent measure against the infection. Human derived neutralizing antibodies are therapeutics and thus fall under the legislation of drugs. However, an alternative could be the purification of efficient neutralizing antibodies from other species. Here, we present immunization of pregnant cows with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 which results in high quantities of colostrum immunoglobulins that can be easily harvested and safely purified within a remarkably short time. The colostrum immunoglobulin preparation has a great potential to serve in formulations that can be used as prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsAnalyses included community-dwelling adults [&ge;]70-years-old with specimen collection between April 4 (epidemiological week 14) and May 1 (week 17). Adjusted VE was estimated by test-negative design through provincial laboratory and immunization data linkage. Cases were RT-PCR test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and controls were test-negative. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of a single-dose [&ge;]21 days before specimen collection, but a range of intervals was assessed. In variant-specific analyses, test-positive cases were restricted to those genetically-characterized as B.1.1.7, P.1 or non-VOC.

ResultsVE analyses included 16,993 specimens: 1,226 (7.2%) test-positive cases and 15,767 test-negative controls. Of 1,131 (92%) viruses genetically categorized, 509 (45%), 314 (28%) and 276 (24%) were B.1.1.7, P.1 and non-VOC lineages, respectively. VE was negligible at 14% (95% CI 0-26) during the period 0-13 days post-vaccination but increased from 43% (95% CI 30-53) at 14-20 days to 75% (95% CI 63-83) at 35-41 days post-vaccination. VE at [&ge;]21 days was 65% (95% CI 58-71) overall: 72% (95% CI 58-81), 67% (95% CI 57-75) and 61% (95% CI 45-72) for non-VOC, B.1.1.7 and P.1, respectively.

ConclusionsA single dose of mRNA vaccine reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in adults [&ge;]70-years-old by about two-thirds, with protection only minimally reduced against B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants. Substantial single-dose protection in older adults reinforces the option to defer the second dose when vaccine supply is scarce and broader first-dose coverage is needed.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed to develop a direct RT-LAMP workflow for viral detection in saliva, and to provide more information regarding its potential in COVID-19 diagnostics.

MethodsClinical and contrived specimens were used to screen/optimize formulations and sample processing protocols. Salivary viral load was determined in symptomatic patients to evaluate clinical performance (n = 90) and to characterize saliva based on age, gender and time from onset of symptoms (n = 49).

ResultsThe devised workflow achieved 93.2% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 0.895 Kappa for salivas containing >102 copies/L. Further analyses in saliva showed peak viral load in the first days of symptoms and lower viral loads in females, particularly among young individuals (<38 years). NOP RT-PCR data did not yield relevant associations.

ConclusionsThis novel saliva RT-LAMP workflow can be applied to point-of-care testing. This work reinforces that saliva better correlates with transmission dynamics than NOP specimens, and reveals gender differences that may reflect higher transmission by males. To maximize detection, testing should be done immediately after symptom onset, especially in females.

HIGHLIGHTS- Development of DGS, a dithiothreitol/guanidine-based solution for stabilization of the viral genome that increases sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva;
- Rapid, cost-effective RT-LAMP assay workflow for viral detection in saliva without need of RNA extraction;

Recent studies have tried to evaluate CHA2DS2-VASc score on admission in COVID-19 patients to predict mortality.

MethodsWe conducted a literature search on 14 April 2021 to retrieve all published studies, pre-prints and grey literature related to the predictive power of CHA2DS2-VASc score in COVID-19 patients of admission and mortality. Screening of studies and data extraction was done by two authors independently. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for the methodological quality assessment of the included studies.

ResultsFive studies involving 5,941 patients reported the predictive value of CHA2DS2-VASc score for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and area under curve were 0.72 (95% CI 0.63-0.79), 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.81) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.83).

ConclusionsCHA2DS2-VASc score at admission has good predictive value for mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection and can help clinicians identify potentially severe cases early. Early initiation of effective management in these cases may help in reducing overall mortality due to COVID-19.

We assessed the efficacy of namilumab, a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitor and infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in order to prioritise agents for phase 3 trials.

MethodsIn this randomised, multi-arm, parallel group, open label, adaptive phase 2 proof-of-concept trial (CATALYST) we recruited hospitalised patients [&ge;] 16 years with COVID-19 pneumonia and C-reactive protein (CRP) [&ge;] 40mg/L in nine UK hospitals. Participants were randomly allocated with equal probability to usual care, or usual care plus a single 150mg intravenous dose of namilumab (150mg) or infliximab (5mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified for ward versus ICU. The primary endpoint was improvement in inflammation in intervention arms compared to control as measured by CRP over time, analysed using Bayesian multi-level models. ISRCTN registry number 40580903.

FindingsBetween 15th June 2020 and 18th February 2021 we randomised 146 participants: 54 to usual care, 57 to namilumab and 35 to infliximab. The probabilities that namilumab and infliximab were superior to usual care in reducing CRP over time were 97% and 15% respectively. Consistent effects were seen in ward and ICU patients and aligned with clinical outcomes, such that the probability of discharge (WHO levels 1-3) at day 28 was 47% and 64% for ICU and ward patients on usual care, versus 66% and 77% for patients treated with namilumab. 134 adverse events occurred in 30/55 (54.5%) namilumab patients compared to 145 in 29/54 (53.7%) usual care patients. 102 events occurred in 20/29 (69.0%) infliximab patients versus 112 events in 17/34 (50.0%) usual care patients.

InterpretationNamilumab, but not infliximab, demonstrated proof-of-concept evidence for reduction in inflammation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia which was consistent with secondary clinical outcomes. Namilumab should be prioritised for further investigation in COVID-19.

Further, protection and hygiene measures like fixed children/staff groups, ventilation and surface disinfection were introduced among ECEC centres. To inform or modify public health measures in ECEC, we investigate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children and staff of ECEC centres in light of social determinants (socioeconomic status of the children) and recommended structural and hygiene measures. We focus on the question if the relevant factors differ between the 2nd (when no variant of concern (VOC) circulated) and the 3rd wave (when VOC B.1.1.7 (Alpha) predominated).

MethodsBased on panel data from a weekly online survey of ECEC centre managers (calendar week 36/2020 to 22/2021, ongoing) including approx. 8500 centres, we estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and staff using random-effect-within-between (REWB) panel models for count data in the 2nd and 3rd wave.

ResultsCentres with a high proportion of children with low socioeconomic status (SES) have a higher risk of infections in staff and children. Strict contact restrictions between groups like fixed group assignments among children and fixed staff assignments to groups prevent infections. Both effects tend to be stronger in the 3rd wave.

ContributionECEC centres with a large proportion of children from a low SES background and lack of using fixed child/staff cohorts experience higher COVID-19 rates. Centres should be supported in maintaining recommended measures over the long run. Preventive measures such as vaccination of staff should be prioritised in centres with large proportions of low SES children.",NA,medrxiv

As in previous studies, the control calculations are in good agreement with observations at all stages of epidemic growth. One of the two model coefficients is uniquely related to the lockdown efficiency parameter. We obtained an approximate correlation between this parameter and the main conditions of lockdown, in particular, physical distancing, reduction in social contacts and strictness of the mask regime.

The calculation of the incident over a seven-day period using the proposed model is in good agreement with the observational data. Analysis of both curves shows that a better agreement can be obtained by taking into account the lag time of the epidemic response of about 10 days.

From the reverse calculation a time-varying curve of the infection rate associated with the ""new"" virus strain under mutation conditions is obtained, which is qualitatively confirmed by the sequencing data.

Based on these studies, it is possible to conclude that the ASILV analytical model developed here can be used to reliably and promptly predict epidemic development under conditions of lockdown and mass vaccination without the use of numerical methods.

The functional relationships identified allow us to conduct a rapid analysis of the impact of each of the model parameters on the overall process of the epidemic.

In contrast to previous studies, the calculations of the proposed model were performed using EXCEL, rather than a standard calculator. This is due to the need to account for multiple changes in lockdown conditions and vaccination rates.",NA,medrxiv

Prolactin activates many genes important in the development of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of breast cancer in women exposed to antipsychotic drugs, stratified by prolactin elevating potential (high, mid, and low), compared to women taking anticonvulsants and/or lithium.

MethodsThe IBM MarketScan Commercial and Medicaid Databases were used to establish a large, observational cohort of women taking antipsychotics drugs compared to control drugs. Invasive breast cancer was identified using diagnostic codes. Bivariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk of breast cancer by antipsychotic drug exposure, both as pooled antipsychotics and by prolactin specific categories.

ResultsA total of 2,708 (0.2%) cases of invasive breast cancer were identified among 1,562,839 women. Exposure to antipsychotics with high prolactin elevating potential was associated with a 23% increased risk of breast cancer (aHR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.35), whereas mid and low prolactin categories of antipsychotics were not significant.

ConclusionIn the largest study of antipsychotics taken by women, a modest risk between antipsychotic drug use and the risk for breast cancer was observed, with a differential higher association with high prolactin elevating drugs.

Mask usage has been advocated by health professionals to minimize its spread. Thus, it is important to develop a simulation that models SARS-CoV-2 spread in indoor environments to evaluate mask usage effectiveness.

MethodsA visual computer simulation was developed with Pygame in Python 3. A virtual indoor supermarket is simulated by a given flow of customers with an initial infection percentage and mask usage percentage who enter, move around, and exit a supermarket with shelves, tables and cashiers to demonstrate a systems dynamic complexity, i.e. nonlinear interactions of system elements over time. A supermarket was simulated with initial infection rates of 5%, 10%, and 20% and mask use percentages of 0%, 25%, 50% 75%, and 100%. The environmental settings (e.g. shelf number and location) and total customers (N=200) were kept constant.

ResultsThe number of infected customers increased as the percentage of mask usage decreased (p < 0.01). At 5% initial infection, almost no infections were observed at 50% mask usage, with a logarithmic best-fit model (R2 = 0.947). At 10% initial infection, the association between mask usage and decrease in number of infections was best fit with a linear model (R2 = 0.924). For 20% initial infection, a quadratic model was the best fit (R2 = 0.934). While a linear model suggests proportional decreases in infection, the quadratic model suggests more significant reductions in infections at higher rates of mask use (i.e. increasing mask usage from 5% to 10% is less impactful than from 65% to 70%).

ConclusionThe results suggest that mask usage has a significant impact on decreasing COVID-19 transmission. Ideally, mask usage should be as high as possible to achieve more significant reductions in COVID-19 infections. Various parameters can be adjusted during simulation as we learn more about SARS-CoV-2 to guide policies for minimizing COVID-19 transmission.",NA,medrxiv

During February 16-17, some US citizens, residents, and their partners voluntarily repatriated to the US from Japan.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, longitudinal evaluation of repatriated travelers where the outcome of interest was a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. Travelers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were isolated in hospitals or at home under county isolation orders and underwent serial testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approximately every other day, as contemporaneous US guidance required two consecutive negative tests collected [&ge;]24 hours apart and symptom improvement before release from isolation.

ResultsAmong quarantined repatriated travelers, 14% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. One-fifth of infected travelers initially tested negative but were identified on subsequent testing. All infected travelers remained asymptomatic or developed mild symptoms during isolation. Many travelers remained in prolonged isolation because of persistent viral detection based on contemporaneous policies.

In RFA, tissue is ablated with high temperatures obtained from electrodes (needles) inserted percutaneously or via an open surgery into the target. RFA treatments are generally not planned in a systematic way, and do not account for nearby organs-at-risk (OARs), potentially leading to sub-optimal treatments and inconsistent treatment quality. We therefore develop a mathematical framework to design RFA treatment plans that provide complete ablation while minimizing healthy tissue damage. Borrowing techniques from radiosurgery inverse planning, we design a two-stage approach where we first identify needle positions and orientations, called needle orientation optimization, and then compute the treatment time for optimal thermal dose delivery, called thermal dose optimization. Several different damage models are used to determine both target and OAR damage. We present numerical results on three clinical case studies. Our findings indicate a need for high source voltage for short tip length (conducting portion of the needle) or fewer needles, and low source voltage for long tip length or more needles to achieve full coverage. Further, more needles yields a larger ablation volume and consequently more OAR damage. Finally, the choice of damage model impacts the source voltage, tip length, and needle quantity.",NA,medrxiv

Two patients in the age group of 30 to 50 years presented within a two month period to a tertiary referral hospital in Texas with septic shock, hepatic abscess and septic thrombophlebitis. Blood cultures were positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae (isolates 2020CK-00441 and 2021CK-00720 respectively).

MethodsWhole genome sequencing was performed using paired-end Illumina MiSeq reads for both isolates. Nanopore sequencing to obtain a closed genome was performed for 2020CK-00441.

Results2020CK-00441 belonged to ST23 type while 2021CK-00720 was a ST65 type isolate. Kleborate analyses predicted with high confidence that both the isolates were hvKp. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the two strains are not closely related to each other or to any other known hvKp isolates. Both the isolates had yersiniabactin, colibactin, aerobactin and salmochelin producing loci which likely confer these isolates hvKp phenotype. 2020CK-00441 had a unique pK2044 like plasmid.

We investigated the effect of infection control measures implemented in the workplace on personal infection prevention behavior.

MethodsWe conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey through the Internet from December 22 to 25, 2020, during which period COVID-19 was spreading. Among respondents aged 20 to 65 years (n=27,036), a total of 21,915 workers were included in the analysis after excluding self-employed workers (n=2,202), workers in small/home offices (n=377), and agriculture, forestry, and fisheries workers (n=212), etc., whose personal infection prevention behavior was almost the same as infection control measures taken in the workplace.

ResultsThe results showed that as the number of infection control measures in the workplace increased, implementation of infection prevention behavior by individuals also significantly increased. However, the relationship differed depending on the type of personal infection prevention behavior. Specifically, infection control measures against COVID-19 in the workplace may affect personal infection prevention behavior.

ConclusionImplementation of infection control measures in the workplace appears to deepen personal understanding of infection prevention behaviors, and increases awareness of the importance of individual infection prevention behavior and its implementation by all individuals.

In Finland, adolescents above 16 years have been largely treated in adult oncology centers in contrast to many Western countries in which the minimum admittance age is 18 years. The aim of this study was to investigate characteristics, therapy and outcome of cancer in adolescents aged 16 to 17 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODSThis retrospective cohort study included adolescents aged 16 to under 18 years at the time of cancer diagnosis between 2000 and 2019 in Tampere University Hospital, a regional tertiary referral center. Clinical data were retrieved from hospital medical records and included diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, therapy and outcome. In addition to standard descriptive statistical analyses, the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression modelling were applied to study the outcome and associated factors.

RESULTSA total of 93 patients were diagnosed with a malignant tumor at the age of 16 or 17 years. Males were more often diagnosed with a cancer (62%), while non-CNS (non-central nervous system) solid cancers were the most common entities (76%) and Hodgkin lymphoma was the most common cancer diagnosis (31%). Seventy patients completed their therapy in the referral center and were followed up for a median of 5.4 years. The majority of patients were treated in the adult department (69%). Complete remission was achieved for 89% of patients, while 21% experienced tumor recurrence. The 5-year event-free survival was 65% (95% CI, 54% to 79%) and overall survival 82% (95% CI, 73% to 93%).

CONCLUSIONSThe majority of cancers in adolescents of 16 to 17 years of age are solid cancers. Patient outcome in our cohort was favorable and is in line with previously published data.",NA,medrxiv

Many risk factors, such as age, gender, and comorbidities, have been studied to explain the variable symptoms of infected patients. However, these effects may not fully account for the diversity in disease severity. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a broad range of patients laboratory and clinical assessments to investigate the genetic contributions to COVID-19 severity. By performing GWAS analysis, we discovered several concrete associations for laboratory features. Based on these findings, we performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causality of laboratory traits on disease severity. From the MR study, we identified two causal traits, cholesterol levels and WBC counts. The functional gene related to cholesterol levels is ApoE and people with particular ApoE genotype are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels, facilitating the process that SARS-CoV-2 binds on its receptor ACE2 and aggravating COVID-19 disease. The functional gene related to WBC counts is MHC system that plays a central role in the immune system. The host immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection greatly affects the patients severity status and clinical outcome. Additionally, our gene-based and GSEA analysis revealed interferon pathways, including type I interferon receptor binding, regulation of IFNA signaling, and SARS coronavirus and innate immunity. We hope that our work will make a contribution in studying the genetic mechanisms of disease illness and serve as useful reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsForty residents and forty staff members either naive or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited in two NH in Belgium before immunization with two doses of 30{micro}g BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at day 0 and day 21. Binding antibodies (Ab) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), spike domains S1 and S2, RBD Ab avidity, and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.351 variant were assessed at days 0, 21, 28, and 49.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 naive residents had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination than naive staff. These poor responses involved lower levels of IgG to all domains of the vaccine antigen, lower avidity of RBD IgG, and lower levels of Ab neutralizing the vaccine strain. No naive resident had detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant. High and comparable Ab responses were observed in residents and staff previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Clustering analysis revealed that poor vaccine responders not only included naive residents but also naive staff, emphasizing the heterogeneity of responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population.

ConclusionsThe poor Ab responses to mRNA vaccination observed in infection naive residents and in some naive staff members of NH suggest suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection, especially with variants of concern. Adapted vaccination regimens may be needed to provide optimal protection against COVID-19 to vulnerable populations.

SettingOutpatient clinic from a public post-COVID-19 health center (CPC) at Bahia-Brazil, a state where 80% are black or mixed race.

ParticipantsPatients admitted between August 2020 and February 2021 with symptoms at least one month after the onset of COVID-19.

Main outcome measuresPACS and related disorders such as hospitalization one month or later after disease onset, biochemical dysregulation and reduced quality of life (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire).

ResultsAmong 683 individuals assisted at CPC in this period, 602 were recruited. Patients had average of 52 ({+/-}14.6) years, 355 (59%) were female, 528 (88%) black/brown. Individuals were classified as mild (39.9%), moderate (27.9%) or severe (32.2%) during acute illness if outpatient, hospitalized non-UCI or UCI, respectively. Most patients reported a polysymptomatic profile, in median eight (IQR=6-9) acute symptoms. The most frequent residual symptoms were dyspnea (66%), fatigue (62%) and chest pain (43%). Women were more affected regardless disease severity at acute stage: presented more residual symptoms [4 (2-6) vs 3 (2-4)] and a higher impact in quality of life. Altered HbA1c [(184/275 (66.9%)], high CRP levels [195/484 (40.3%)] and anemia [143/545 (26.2%)] were the most common abnormalities in laboratory exams. 76 patients presented HbA1c above 6.4% although only 42 referred previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. After one month of disease onset, 30 patients required hospitalization, including seven cases with mild acute illness. Hospital admission after acute disease was required on 30 patients, seven (23%) were mild. Quality of life had been affected for 357/404 (88.4%) patients according to EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5L), mainly the domains of anxiety/depression [severe or extreme anxiety for 79/401 (19.7%)] and pain/discomfort [severe or extreme pain for 71/403 (17.6%)]. The median EuroQoL Global Score was 70 [IQR 50-80]. PACS symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue, was associated with decreased quality of life.

ConclusionsPACS, such as dyspnea, chest pain and fatigue, occurred after variable degree of disease severity. Among this majority black/mixed-race patients, woman seemed to be more affected. Other consequences included post-acute hospitalization, and abnormal glucose metabolism and reduced quality of life.

Summary BoxSection 1: What is already known on this topic:

{checkmark}Post-Acute COVID Syndrome (PACS) comprises a set of persistent or new-onset symptoms after illness onset.
{checkmark}As far as we know, there are no studies describing PACS in a population principally black and mixed-race. Additionally, few studies have addressed PACS among outpatients.


Section 2: What this study adds:

{checkmark}Similar PACS were reported after mild, moderate and severe illness. Dyspnea, fatigue and chest pain were the most prevalent symptoms in this population presenting majority of black/mixed-race patients.

MethodologyDescriptive cross-sectional study of 74 patients with LC for at least 4 months since diagnosis. The collected data were: information on the COVID-19 episode and the persistent symptoms, medical history and a specific cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through flow cytometry, assessing the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by T4 lymphocytes, T8 lymphocytes and NK cells. Descriptive and comparative analyses were carried out.

ResultsPatients with LC had negative serology for Covid-19 in 89% of cases but 96% showed specific cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 an average of 9.5 months after infection: 89% of this response corresponded to T8 lymphocytes, 58% to NK cells, and 51% to T4 lymphocyte (20% negligibly positive). Most of them had altered immune cell typing and we found that T4 lymphocyte counts were low in 34% of cases and NK cell high in 64%.

The collected data were: information on the COVID-19 episode and the persistent symptoms, medical history and a specific cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through flow cytometry, assessing the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by T4 lymphocytes, T8 lymphocytes and NK cells. Descriptive and comparative analyses were carried out.

ResultsPatients with LC had negative serology for Covid-19 in 89% of cases but 96% showed specific cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 an average of 9.5 months after infection: 89% of this response corresponded to T8 lymphocytes, 58% to NK cells, and 51% to T4 lymphocyte (20% negligibly positive). Most of them had altered immune cell typing and we found that T4 lymphocyte counts were low in 34% of cases and NK cell high in 64%. Macrophage populations were detected in the peripheral blood of 7% of them. Patients displayed a higher percentage of illnesses related to &[Prime]abnormal&[Prime] immune responses, either preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection (43%) or following it in 23% of cases.

ConclusionThe immune system appears to have an important involvement in the development of LC and viral persistence could be the cause or consequence of it. Further analysis with a control group should be performed.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThe study design was informed by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership approach. A three-stage consensus-based process of consultation to identify research priorities using qualitative and quantitative methods. Research was guided by a steering group comprising researchers, third sector partners, clinicians, parents/carers and young people. A Young Peoples Advisory Group contributed at each stage.

ResultsInitial steps generated 26 research questions of importance to children and young people; these were ranked by 357 participants (229 children and young people and 128 adults). Consensus was reached for the prioritization of four topics for future research: (i) the impact of exposure to adult content on young peoples mental health and relationships; (ii) the relationship between screen use and the wellbeing of young people from vulnerable groups; (iii) the impact of screen use on brain development; and (iv) the relationship between screen use and sleep.

Additionally, young participants prioritized questions about online bullying, advertisements targeting young people, and the relationship between social media and specific mental health conditions. Research topics of interest arising specifically during the pandemic included the effects on adolescent mental health of exposure to constant news updates and online racial bias, and how young people take part in activism online

ConclusionThese findings will enable researchers and funders to conduct research that is needs-oriented and relevant to the target audience.

O_TEXTBOXKey points and relevance of the study{blacksquare} Evidence about the effects of screen use on adolescent mental health is weak and has been driven by researchers and technology developers.
{blacksquare}Young people, parents and teachers prioritized research questions about exposure to adult content online; wellbeing of vulnerable populations; impact of screen use on development; and relation of screen use with sleep.
{blacksquare}Young people additionally prioritized research questions related to social media and developing specific mental disorders, online bullying, and companies exploiting adolescents vulnerabilities (for example through targeted publicity).

Whether dementia influences atrophy independent of neuropathologies is not known. In this study, we examined the pattern of atrophy associated with dementia while accounting for the most common dementia-related neuropathologies.

MethodsWe used data from National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC, N=129) and Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=47) participants with suitable in-vivo 3D-T1w MRI and autopsy data. We determined dementia status at visit closest to MRI. We examined the following dichotomized neuropathological variables: Alzheimers disease neuropathology, hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy Bodies, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) identified areas associated with dementia after accounting for neuropathologies. Identified regions of interest were further analyzed. We used multiple linear regression models adjusted for neuropathologies and demographic variables.

ResultsWe found strong associations for dementia with volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampus (semi-partial correlations[&ge;]0.28, P<0.0001 for all regions in NACC; semi-partial correlations[&ge;]0.35, P[&le;]0.01 for hippocampus and parahippocampus in ADNI). Dementia status accounted for more unique variance in atrophy in these structures ([~]8%) compared with neuropathological variables; the only exception was hippocampal sclerosis which accounted for more variance in hippocampal atrophy (10%).

ConclusionEven after accounting for the most common neuropathologies, dementia still had among the strongest correlations with atrophy of medial temporal lobe structures. This suggests that atrophy of the medial temporal lobe is most related to clinical status of dementia as opposed to Alzheimers or other neuropathologies.",NA,medrxiv

Olfactory loss can be assessed in many ways but seems to be little realized in a daily clinical practice. The sniffin Sticks test - 12 items (SST-12) can be used in quick olfactory disorders screening. Its use in a post-covid19 situation was the main objective of this work.

MethodologyConsecutive patients consulting to the ENT department with post-Covid-19 olfactory loss were included. The clinical examination included an analog scale for the self-assessment of olfactory recovery (VAS), self-reported salt and sugar intake, a nasofibroscopy, the complete Sniffin Stick Test (SST) and the SST-12.

ResultsAmong the 54 patients included, based on the SST-12, 14,8% (n=8) of the patients could be classified as normosmic (SST-12[&ge;]11), 48,1% (n=26) as hyposmic (6< SST-12<10) and 37% (n=20) as functional anosmic (SST-12[&le;]6). We report excellent and significant correlations between SST-12 and SST or VAS assessments. Salt and Sugar increased intake seems significantly related to SST-12 results.

ConclusionsSST-12 is a reliable way to screen post-COVID-19 olfactory disorders could be used in a daily clinical practice and might be used to prevent bad diet habits and so cardiovascular risk.",NA,medrxiv

Recent reports quantifying the extent by which VOC can evade vaccine immunity resulted in a range of estimates for the same VOC, which makes them difficult to interpret. One possible explanation for the discrepancies between different studies is an inconsistency in terms of the time post-vaccination of the sampled population. Here we present a model based on the observed correlation between antibody neutralization levels and vaccine efficacy, which demonstrates the impact of time post-vaccination on the comparison of the vaccine efficacy for VOC versus non-VOC infections. Our model predicts and exemplifies several possible consequences for vaccine efficacy in VOC infections: 1) a delay in the onset of vaccine efficacy against VOC; 2) a transient increase in susceptibility to breakthrough infection with VOC compared to non-VOC as a function of time after vaccination. We review preliminary data indicating that such phenomena are observed in studies of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. We find that ignoring the strong dependence on the time post-vaccination can lead to contradictory reports of relative efficacy against VOC versus non-VOC, with implications on mitigation strategies against VOC and the design of vaccine efficacy studies.",NA,medrxiv

A proliferation of compartmental models was observed in the mathematical modelling community, aiming to understand and make predictions regarding the spread of COVID-19. Such approach has its own advantages and challenges: while compartmental models are suitable to simulate large populations, the underlying well-mixed population assumption might be problematic when considering non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) which strongly affect the connectivity between individuals in the population. Here we propose a correction to an extended age-structured SEIR framework with dynamic transmission modelled using contact matrices for different settings in Brazil. By assuming that the mitigation strategies for COVID-19 affect the connections between different households, network percolation theory predicts that the connectivity across all households decreases drastically above a certain threshold of removed connections. We incorporated this emergent effect at population level by modulating the home contact matrices through a percolation correction function, with the few remaining parameters fitted to to hospitalisation and mortality data from the city of Sao Paulo. We found significant support for the model with implemented percolation effect using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).

In this study we conducted an observational analysis which included COVID-19 data with over 12,000,000 PCR tests from 250 cities in Israel. In addition, we performed a simulation of different vaccination campaigns to find the optimal policy.

Our analysis revealed that cities with younger populations reached a decrease in new cases when a lower percentage of their residents were immunized, showing that median age is a crucial parameter effecting overall immunity, while other parameters appeared to be insignificant. This variance between cities is explained by recalculating the immunized population and multiplying each individual by a factor symbolizing the impact of their age on the spread on the virus. This factor is easily calculated from historical data of positive cases per age.

The simulation proves that prioritizing different age groups or changing the rate of vaccinations drastically effects the overall hospitalizations and positive cases.

In this study, three SARS-CoV-2 target genes (N1, N2, and E) were quantified from wastewater influent samples (n = 250) obtained from the capital city and 7 other cities in various size in central Ohio from July 2020 to January 2021. To determine human-specific fecal strength in wastewater samples more accurately, two human fecal viruses (PMMoV and crAssphage) were quantified to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater. To estimate the trend of new case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 gene levels, different statistical models were built and evaluated. From the longitudinal data, SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater strongly correlated with daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases (average Spearmans r = 0.70, p < 0.05), with the N2 gene being the best predictor of the trend of confirmed cases. Moreover, average daily case numbers can help reduce the noise and variation from the clinical data. Among the models tested, the quadratic polynomial model performed best in correlating and predicting COVID-19 cases from the wastewater surveillance data, which can be used to track the effectiveness of vaccination in the later stage of the pandemic. Interestingly, neither of the normalization methods using PMMoV or crAssphage significantly enhanced the correlation with new case numbers, nor improved the estimation models.

Previous studies on the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have been among hospitalised patients, which may have exaggerated risk estimates of severe outcomes because all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pregnant population were not included. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy independent of severity of infection in a universally tested population, and to identify risk factors for and outcomes after severe infection requiring hospital admission.

Material and MethodsThis was a prospective population-based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Microbiology Database and prospectively registered data from medical records. We included all pregnancies between March 1 and October 31, 2020 and compared women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during pregnancy to non-infected pregnant women. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were both identified prospectively and through register linkage to secure that all cases were identified and that cases were pregnant during infection. Main outcome measures were pregnancy, delivery, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Severe infection was defined as hospital admission due to COVID-19.

ResultsAmong 82 682 pregnancies, 418 women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, corresponding to an incidence of 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies, 23 (5.5%) of which required hospital admission due to COVID-19. Risk factors for infection were asthma (OR 2.19 [1.41-3.41]) and being foreign born (OR 2.12 [1.70-2.64]). Risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19 included obesity (OR 2.74 [1.00-7.51]), smoking (OR 4.69 [1.58-13.90]), infection after gestational age (GA) 22 weeks (GA 22-27 weeks: OR 3.77 [1.16-12.29]; GA 28-36 weeks: OR 4.76 [1.60-14.12]) and having asthma (OR 4.53 [1.39-14.79]). We found no difference in any obstetric or neonatal outcomes.

ConclusionsOnly 1 in 20 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy require admission to hospital due to COVID-19. And severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are rare.

Key MessagePopulation based cohort study about SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Asthma and foreign ethnicity were identified as risk factors for infection while obstetric outcomes did not change. Obesity, smoking, infection after GA 22, and asthma increased the risk of hospital admission.",NA,medrxiv

Methodsa retrospective survey was conducted to analyze occupational exposure populations by influence factors (gender, age, occupation, occurrence places, occurrence links, and exposure of pathogens types.

ResultsThere were 220 medical staff of blood-borne occupational exposure in the hospital in Hubei Province from 2015 to 2017 to be investigated, and the blood-borne occupational exposure populations were mainly concentrated on nurses (65%) and doctors (31.82%) (both of populations accounted for 96.82% in total occupational exposure medical staff), and the age of blood-borne occupational exposure populations were mainly 20~29 years old (61.82%), followed by 30~39 years old (26.82%), 40~49 years old (8.64%), and >50 years old (2.73%). The main occurrence places for blood-borne occupational exposure were wards (46.36%) and treatment room/disposal rooms(26.36%); the main occurrence links of blood-borne occupational exposure were mainly injured during needle extraction (29.09%), stab and cut during treatment (23.64%), disposal of waste (17.27%) and accidental injury during operation (16.82%). The main pathogen types of blood-borne occupational exposure were hepatitis B (HBV) and syphilis, accounting for 36.36% and 10.45%, respectively.

ConclusionsThe population of blood-borne occupational exposure in this hospital mainly concentrated in nurses aged 20-29 years old, followed by doctors, mainly happened at wards and treatment rooms/disposal rooms; the high-risk links were mainly injured during needle extraction and stab and cut during treatment, and the main pathogen types were HBV and syphilis. Those evidences showed that to strengthen the awareness of prevention and operation standard training for the related medical staff (mainly nurses and doctors aged 20-29 years old) and to supervise the relevant departments to do a good job of supervision, it can greatly reduce the incidence and risk of blood-borne occupational exposure in this hospital.",NA,medrxiv

We hypothesized that the degree and severity of reactogenicity after the second injection reflects the magnitude of antibody production against the SARS CoV-2 virus spike protein (spike IgG). Blood samples were obtained from 67 healthy Japanese healthcare workers three weeks after the first injection and two weeks after the second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine to measure spike IgG levels. Using questionnaires, we calculated an adverse event (AE) score (0-11) for each participant. The geometric mean of spike IgG titers increased from 1,047 antibody units (AU/mL) (95% CI: 855-1282 AU/mL) after the first injection to 17,378 AU/mL (14,622-20,663 AU/mL) after the second injection. The median AE score increased from 2 to 5. Spike IgG levels after the second injection were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with spike IgG after the first injection. AE scores after the second injection were not significantly associated with log-transformed spike IgG after the second injection, when adjusted for age, sex, and log-transformed spike IgG after the first injection.

The number of countries reporting Variants of Concern (VOCs) with such mutations continues to rise. Here, we investigate two scenarios for third waves of the COVID pandemic: one driven by increased transmissibility, and another driven by immune escape. We do this using three mathematical models: a parsimonious susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic model with homogeneous mixing, an age-structured SARS-CoV-2 transmission model and a stochastic importation model. We calibrated our models to the situation in England in May 2021, although the insights will generalise to other contexts. We therefore accurately captured infection dynamics and vaccination rates, and also used these to explore the potential impact of a putative new VOC-targeted vaccine. Epidemiological trajectories for putative VOCs are wide-ranging and heavily dependent on their transmissibility, immune escape capability, and the time at which a postulated VOC-targeted vaccine may be introduced. We demonstrate that a VOC with either a substantial transmission advantage over resident variants, or the ability to evade vaccine-derived and prior immunity, is expected to generate a wave of infections and hospitalisations comparable to those seen in the winter 2020-21 wave. Moreover, a variant that is less transmissible, but shows partial immune-escape could provoke a wave of infection that would not be revealed until control measures are further relaxed.",NA,medrxiv

When asked in November 2020 about the intention to take the Covid-19 vaccine, the French public showed, once again, reluctance. Therefore, France appeared as an ideal case study to analyze whether the hostility toward the Covid-19 vaccine has its own reasons or whether it is related to the reluctance to the principle of vaccination itself. Our objective was to determine the specificity of the social determinants of the intention to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Thanks to the use of a large random sample of the general population in France (86,000 individuals), the reluctant to Covid-19 vaccine could be clearly distinguished from the hesitant and the convinced, and thereby thoroughly analyzed. Our analysis highlighted a gendered reluctance toward vaccination in general but even more so regarding vaccination against Covid-19. It might refer to women being more concerned about the possible effects of an injection in their body, especially at the age of maternity and a differentiated socialization making them more sensitive than men to long-term risks and more apprehensive toward rapid technological change. We also found that people at the bottom of the social hierarchy, in terms of level of education, financial resources, and immigration status, were more likely to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine. Nevertheless, this reluctance was less prominent than for vaccination in general, reflecting the actual spread of the epidemic in various social milieux. Finally, our analysis showed that trust in the governments actions was significantly associated with reluctance toward the Covid-19 vaccine, even more than toward vaccination in general.

DesignThe FEERIC study (Fertility, Pregnancy, Contraception after BC in France) is a prospective, multicenter study.

SettingWeb-based collaborative research platform Seintinelles.

Patients517 patients with prior BC diagnosis free from relapse and aged 18 to 43 years at inclusion (from 12th March 2018 to 27th June 2019).

InterventionBaseline online self-administered questionnaires.

Main Outcome MeasureFertility preservation procedures at BC diagnosis.

ResultsMedian age at BC diagnosis was 33.6 years and 424 patients (82.0%) received chemotherapy. Overall, 236 (45.6%) patients were offered specialized oncofertility counseling, 124 (24.0%) underwent one or more FP procedures with material preservation (oocytes n=108, 20.9%; embryos n=31, 6.0%; both oocytes and embryos n=13, 2.5%; ovarian cryopreservation n=6, 1.2%) and 78 patients received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (15.1%). With a median follow-up of 26.7 months after the end of treatments,133 pregnancies (25.7%) had occurred in 85 patients (16.4%), including 20 unplanned pregnancies (15.0%). Most of the pregnancies were spontaneous (n=113, 87.6%), while 16 (12.4%) required medical interventions. Patients who had an unplanned pregnancy were less likely to have received fertility counseling (p=0.02) and contraceptive counseling (p=0.08) at BC diagnosis.

ConclusionMost of the patients were not offered proper specialized oncofertility counseling at the time of BC diagnosis. Spontaneous pregnancies after BC were very much more frequent than pregnancies resulting from the use of cryopreserved gametes. Adequate contraceptive counseling seems as important as information about fertility and might prevent unplanned pregnancies.",NA,medrxiv

Here we followed T cell and antibody responses in 24 mainly non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects at two time points (median of 45- and 145-days post-symptom onset). Antibody responses were detected in 95% of subjects, with a strong correlation between plasma and salivary anti-S and anti-RBD IgG, as well as a correlation between circulating T follicular helper cells and the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG response. Based on intracellular cytokine production or proliferation, CD4+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in all subjects, decaying with a half-life of 5-6 months for S-specific IL-2-producing cells. CD4+ responses were largely of the T helper 1 phenotype, but with a lower ratio of IFN-{gamma}: IL-2 producing cells and a lower frequency of CD8+: CD4+ T cells compared to influenza A virus-(IAV)-specific memory responses within the same subjects. Analysis of secreted molecules also revealed a lower ratio of IFN-{gamma}: IL-2 and IFN-{gamma}: IL-6 and an altered cytotoxic profile for S- and N-specific compared to IAV-specific responses. These data suggest that the memory T-cell phenotype after a single infection with SARS-CoV-2 persists over time, with an altered cytokine and cytotoxic profile compared to long term memory to IAV within the same subjects.

Materials and MethodsA real time Artificial Intelligence (AI) image quality feedback tool is developed that analyzes chest PA x-rays right after the completion of the examination at the x-ray system and provides visual feedback to the system operator with respect to adherence to desired standards of collimation, patient rotation and inspiration. In order to track image quality changes over time, results were compared to image quality assessment for images, acquired prior to system implementation.

ResultsCompared to the image quality prior to the installation of the real time image quality feedback solution, it is shown that a relative increase of images with optimal image quality with respect to collimation, patient rotation and inspiration is achieved by 30% (p<0.01). A relative improvement of 28% (p<0.01) is observed for the increase of images with optimal collimation, followed by a relative increase of 4% (p<0.01) of images with optimal inspiration. Finally, a detailed analysis is presented that shows that the average unnecessarily exposed area is reduced by 34% (p<0.01).

DiscussionThis study shows that it is possible to significantly improve image quality using a real time AI-based image quality feedback tool.

Despite the importance of NPI, their implementation has been monitored in an ad hoc and uncoordinated manner, mainly through the manual efforts of volunteers. Given the absence of systematic NPI tracking, authorities and researchers are limited in their ability to quantify the effectiveness of NPI and guide decisions regarding their use during the progression of a global pandemic. To address this issue, we propose 3-stage machine learning framework called EpiTopics to facilitate the surveillance of NPI by mining the vast amount of unlabelled news reports about these interventions. Building on topic modeling, our method characterizes online government reports and media articles related to COVID-19 as a mixture of latent topics. Our key contribution is the use of transfer-learning to address the limited number of NPI-labelled documents and topic modelling to support interpretation of the results. At stage 1, we trained a modified version of the unsupervised dynamic embedded topic model (DETM) on 1.2 million international news reports related to COVID-19. At stage 2, we used the trained DETM to infer topic mixture from a small set of 2000 NPI-labelled WHO documents as the input features for predicting NPI labels on each document. At stage 3, we supply the inferred country-level temporal topics from the DETM to the pretrained document-level NPI classifier to predict country-level NPIs. We identified 25 interpretable topics, over 4 distinct and coherent COVID-related themes. These topics contributed to significant improvements in predicting the NPIs labelled in the WHO documents and in predicting country-level NPIs. Together, our work lay the machine learning methodological foundation for future research in global-scale surveillance of public health interventions.

However, a key outstanding question is whether COVID-19 drives a unique program of neutrophil activation or effector functions that contributes to the severe pathogenesis of this pandemic illness, and whether this unique neutrophil response can be targeted to attenuate disease. Using a combination of high-dimensional single cell analysis and ex vivo functional assays of neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared to non-COVID ARDS (caused by bacterial pneumonia), we identified a functionally distinct landscape of neutrophil activation in COVID-19 ARDS that was intrinsically programmed during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

None of these strains were found in the 1645 children (controls) who did not acquire any of these diseases. Ten other strains were exclusive to those who remained disease-free. In most cases, the presence or absence of these bacteria were strongly associated with: 1) high-risk class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles; 2) dietary factors; or 3) a combination of HLA genetics and diet. These results have three significant implications: 1) certain class II HLA haplotypes may serve as bacterial gatekeepers early in life, altering microbiome composition thereby creating the potential for dysbiosis and inflammation; 2) the gut microbiome dysbiosis and inflammation during infancy, largely derived from host HLA genetics and diet, may be a common precedent to all five autoimmune diseases and autism; and 3) HLA gatekeeping may prevent gut colonization of beneficial bacteria in those genetically at-risk individuals who could most benefit from probiotic therapy.

However, there are open questions on how such a mobility data can be used effectively within epidemic models and for which tasks they are best suited. In this paper, we extract a number of graph-based proximity metrics from high resolution cellphone trace data from X-Mode and use it to study COVID-19 epidemic spread in 50 land grant university counties in the US. We present an approach to estimate the effect of mobility on cases by fitting an ODE based model and performing multivariate linear regression to explain the estimated time varying transmissibility. We find that, while mobility plays a significant role, the contribution is heterogeneous across the counties, as exemplified by a subsequent correlation analysis. We subsequently evaluate the metrics utility for case surge prediction defined as a supervised classification problem, and show that the learnt model can predict surges with 95% accuracy and 87% F1-score.",NA,medrxiv

Patients with left-lateralized ATL atrophy typically meet criteria for semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of verbal semantic knowledge. There is less consensus regarding the symptoms that emerge when atrophy targets the right ATL (rATL), but previous studies have emphasized prosopagnosia as well as alterations in emotion, memory, behavior, and semantic knowledge, symptoms that often lead to a diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The goal of the present study was to characterize the cognitive and socioemotional deficits of patients with rATL degeneration in order to refine current conceptualizations of the rATL clinical syndrome.

We identified individuals clinically diagnosed as bvFTD or PPA in our cohort of patients prospectively evaluated for FTD-spectrum disorders. We selected patients who also underwent structural MRI and a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation (n = 478). Based on structural MRI atrophy index, individuals with predominant, rATL atrophy (n = 46) were identified and patients with co-occurrence of significant frontal atrophy were excluded. Nineteen patients with rATL degeneration had undergone autopsy. We used the clinical histories to identify early symptoms and examined the cognitive, socioemotional, genetic, and pathological profiles of patients with rATL degeneration.

In patients with rATL degeneration, the most common early clinical symptoms were loss of empathy (27%), person-specific semantic knowledge (23%), and complex compulsions (18%). On socioemotional testing and informant-reported measures, patients exhibited diminished interpersonal warmth, empathy, and emotional theory of mind. Neuropsychological testing revealed deficits in identifying famous people and discriminating facial affect despite preserved face perception. FTLD-TDP was the most frequent pathological correlate of rATL degeneration (84%), followed by Picks type (10%), a subtype of FTLD-tau.

Our results indicate that patients with early, rATL-predominant degeneration present with a behavioral syndrome that results from loss of empathy for others. The underlying mechanism is a progressive loss of semantic knowledge for concepts of social-emotional relevance. We herein refer to this syndrome as ""emotional semantic variant frontotemporal dementia."" We propose novel diagnostic criteria for this rATL syndrome in order to facilitate early identification in clinical and research settings. This classification is relevant because, if appropriately diagnosed, these patients most often have FTLD-TDP Type-C pathology.",NA,medrxiv

In coherence with previous studies, we observed 2 independent signals at the chr3p21.31 locus (rs73062389-A, OR=1.22, P=7.64x10-14 and rs13092887-A, OR=1.73, P=2.38x10-8, in Europeans) modulating susceptibility and severity, respectively, and a signal influencing susceptibility at the ABO locus (rs9411378-A, OR=1.10, P =7.36x10-10, in Europeans), which was more significant in men than in women (P=0.01). In addition, we detected 7 genome-wide significant signals in the last data release analyzed (on February 24th 2021), of which 4 were associated with susceptibility (SCRT2, LRMDA, chr15q24.2, MIR3681HG), 2 with hospitalization (ANKS1A, chr12p13.31) and 1 for severity (ADGRE1). Finally, we identified over 300 associations which increased in significance over time, and reached at least P<10-5 in the last data release analyzed. We replicated 2 of these signals in an independent dataset: a variant downstream of CCL3 (rs2011959) associated with severity in men, and a variant located in an ATP5PO intron (rs12482569) associated with hospitalization.

However, despite availability of expansive gene expression and epigenomic data sets, few variant-to-gene links have emerged. We identified 139 genes in which protein-coding variants cause severe or familial forms of nine human traits. We then computed the association between common complex forms of the same traits and non-coding variation, revealing that most such traits are also associated with non-coding variation in the vicinity of the same genes. However, we found colocalization evidence--the same variant influencing both the physiological trait and gene expression--for only 7% of genes, and transcriptome-wide association evidence with correct direction of effect for only 4% of genes, despite an abundance of eQTLs in most loci. Fine mapping variants to regulatory elements and assigning these to genes by linear distance similarly failed to implicate most genes in complex traits. These results contradict the hypothesis that most complex trait-associated variants coincide with currently ascertained expression quantitative trait loci.

ObjectiveWe aimed to determine if vaccination reduces hospital visits and severe disease in breakthrough COVID-19 infections.

DesignMulticenter observational cohort analysis

SettingEight-hospital acute care regional health system in Michigan, USA

ParticipantsConsecutive adult patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency care (EC)/hospitalization were eligible participants. Between December 15, 2020 and April 30, 2021, 11,834 EC encounters with COVID-19 infection were included.

ExposuresCOVID-19 vaccination

Main Outcomes and MeasuresPrimary endpoint was rate of COVID-19 emergency care/hospitalization encounters comparing unvaccinated (UV), partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV) cases. Secondary outcome was severe disease represented as a composite outcome (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death).

Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from the electronic record. Vaccination data was obtained from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry and the Centers for Disease Control vaccine tracker.

Results10,880 (91.9%) UV, 825 (7%) PV, and 129 (1.1%) FV were included. Average age was 53.0 {+/-} 18.2 and 52.8% were female. Accounting for the COVID-19 vaccination population groups in Michigan, the ED encounters/hospitalizations rate relevant to COVID-19 infection was 96% lower in FV versus UV (e{beta}:0.04,95% CI 0.03 to 0.06, p <0.001) in negative binomial regression. COVID-19 EC visits rate peaked at 22.61, 12.88, and 1.29 visits per 100000 for the UV, PV, and FV groups, respectively. In the propensity-score matching weights analysis, FV had a lower risk of composite disease compared to UV but statistically insignificant (HR 0.84 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38).

ConclusionsThe need for emergency care and/or hospitalization due to breakthrough COVID-19 is an exceedingly rare event in fully vaccinated patients. As vaccination has increased within our region, emergency visits amongst fully vaccinated individuals have remained low and occur much less frequently when compared to unvaccinated individuals. In cases of breakthrough COVID-19, if hospital-based treatment is required, elderly patients with significant comorbidities remain at high risk for severe outcomes regardless of vaccination status.",NA,medrxiv

CD16 expression enabled immune complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Age-dependent generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells.

We aimed to assess the reproducibility of GEH metrics.

MethodsGEH was measured on two 10-second 12-lead ECGs recorded on the same day in 4,316 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (age 69.4{+/-}9.4 y; 2317(54%) female, 1728 (40%) white, 1138(26%) African-American, 519(12%) Asian-American, 931(22%) Hispanic-American). GEH was measured on a median beat, comprised of the normal sinus (N), atrial fibrillation/flutter (S), and ventricular-paced (VP) beats. Spatial ventricular gradients (SVGs) scalar was measured as sum absolute QRST integral (SAIQRST) and vector magnitude QT integral (VMQTi).

ResultsTwo N ECGs with heart rate (HR) bias of -0.64 (95% limits of agreement [LOA] - 5.68 to 5.21) showed spatial area QRS-T angle (aQRST) bias of -0.12 (95%LOA -14.8 to 14.5). Two S ECGs with HR bias of 0.20 (95%LOA -15.8 to 16.2) showed aQRST bias of 1.37 (95%LOA -33.2 to 35.9). Two VP ECGs with HR bias of 0.25 (95%LOA -3.0 to 3.5) showed aQRST bias of -1.03 (95%LOA -11.9 to 9.9). After excluding premature arial or ventricular beat and two additional beats (before and after extrasystole), the number of cardiac beats included in a median beat did not affect the GEH reproducibility. Mean-centered log-transformed values of SAIQRST and VMQTi demonstrated perfect agreement (Bias 0; 95%LOA -0.092 to 0.092).

ConclusionGEH measurements on N, S, and VP median beats are reproducible. SVGs scalar can be measured as either SAIQRST or VMQTi.

SignificanceSatisfactory reproducibility of GEH metrics supports their implementation.

HighlightsO_LIVCG metrics are reliably reproducible, which supports their implementation.
C_LIO_LIGEH is reproducible if measured during atrial fibrillation or ventricular pacing.
C_LIO_LIScalar of spatial ventricular gradient can be measured as either SAIQRST or VMQTi.

MethodsThis birth cohort from Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, included 773 live births. Mothers with no thyroid disease enrolled at their first prenatal care visit or delivery. Acetaminophen was measured in meconium for 393 children at delivery. Physician diagnosis of ADHD was determined when children were 6-7 years old. We first tested associations of prenatal acetaminophen with birthweight, preterm birth, gestational age, and small and large for gestational age. Then we assessed whether these birth outcomes mediate the association of prenatal acetaminophen with ADHD. We imputed missing data via multiple imputation and used inverse probability weighting to account for confounding and selection bias.

ResultsAcetaminophen was detected in 222 meconium samples (56.5%). Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with decreased birthweight by 136 grams ({beta} = -136; 95%CI [-229, - 43]), 20% increased weekly hazard of delivery (hazard ratio = 1.20; 95%CI [1.00, 1.43]), and over 60% decreased odds of being born large for gestational age (odds ratio = 0.38; 95%CI [0.20, 0.75]).

We informally reviewed the extant literature and conducted semi-structured interviews with a group of 12 clinicians, students and researchers who had administered standardized language and literacy assessments with typically developing children between the ages of four and eight, in a virtual setting. Six themes: candidacy for virtual assessment, communication and collaboration with caregivers, technology and equipment, virtual administration, ethics, consent and confidentiality, and special considerations for bilingual populations were discussed, to develop a set of recommendations to guide the use of standardized assessments in a virtual setting. In line with the Guidelines International Network, these recommendations were rated by group members, and reviewed by external stakeholders. This paper is one of the first to share recommended practices for virtual assessment in the domain of oral language assessment.

Disturbed amygdala-frontal network functions are central to the pathophysiology of SAD, marked by hypoactivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hypersensitivity of the medial PFC and amygdala. The objective of this study was to determine whether modulation of dorsolateral and medial PFC activity with a novel intensified stimulation protocol reduces SAD core symptoms, improves treatment-related variables, and reduces attention bias to threatening stimuli.

MethodsIn this randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial, we assessed the efficacy of an intensified stimulation protocol (20 min, twice-daily sessions with 20 min intervals, 5 consecutive days) in two intensities (1 vs 2 mA) compared to sham stimulations. 45 patients with SAD were randomized in three tDCS arms. SAD symptoms, treatment-related variables (worries, depressive state, emotion regulation, quality of life), and attention bias to threatening stimuli (dot-probe paradigm) were assessed before and right after the intervention. SAD symptoms were also assessed at 2-month follow-up.

ResultsBoth 1 mA and 2mA protocols significantly reduced fear/avoidance symptoms, worries and improved, emotion regulation and quality of life after the intervention compared to the sham group. Improving effect of the 2 mA protocol on avoidance symptoms, worries and depressive state was significantly larger than the 1 mA group. Only the 2 mA protocol reduced attention bias to threat-related stimuli, the avoidance symptom at follow-up, and depressive states, as compared to the sham group.

ConclusionsModulation of lateral-medial PFC activity with intensified stimulation can improve cognitive control, motivation and emotion networks in SAD and thereby results in therapeutic effects. These effects can be larger with 2 mA vs 1 mA intensities, though a linear relationship between intensity and efficacy should not be concluded.",10.1016/j.brs.2021.06.005,medrxiv

In many low-burden countries, LTBI is concentrated within migrant populations reflecting higher disease burden in some countries of origin; national programmes may consequently focus on screening and treating LTBI in migrants to prevent future TB cases. However, little is known about the extent to which migrants initiate treatment for LTBI when testing positive, and their treatment outcomes, which is urgently needed if we are to strengthen these programmes, improve migrant health, and meet TB elimination targets.

MethodsWe did a systematic review and meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines and PROSPERO registered (CRD42019140338) to pool global data on LTBI initiation and completion amongst migrants (defined as foreign born), and secondary outcomes to explore the range of both personal and provider level factors associated with initiation and completion. We searched Embase, Medline and Global Health, and hand-searched grey literature (from Jan 1 2000 to Apr 21 2020). Inclusion criteria were primary research articles reporting on LTBI treatment initiation and/or completion amongst migrants; we excluded papers where data were not stratified by migrant status, or where the data related to outcomes prior to the year 2000. There were no geographical or language restrictions.

Results39 publications were included from 13 countries, with treatment initiation and completion data for 31,598 LTBI positive migrants. Overall, 69% (95% CI=51-84%; I2=99.62%) of these initiated treatment; 74% (95% CI=66-81%; I2=99.19%) of migrants who initiated treatment, completed it; among studies with data on the complete pathway from screening positive to completing treatment, 52% (95% CI=40-64%; I2=98.90%) successfully completed treatment. Meta-regression showed that LTBI programmes are improving, with more recent reported data (2010-2020) associated with better rates of treatment initiation and completion. European studies also appeared to have more successful outcomes than those in the Americas and Western Pacific WHO regions.

ConclusionsLTBI treatment initiation and completion amongst migrants have room for improvement. Though the data show improvements in the past decade, the delivery of these programmes will need further strengthening if we are to meet targets to eradicate TB in low-incidence countries. Greater focus will need to be placed on engaging migrants more effectively in the clinic and understanding the diverse barriers and facilitators to migrants initiating and completing treatment. Such efforts must be mindful of, and sensitive to the unique experiences individuals arriving in a new country.

O_TEXTBOXO_TEXTBOXNOPanel: Research in ContextC_TEXTBOXNO Evidence before this studyLatent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is one of the most prevalent infections globally, affecting an estimated 25% of the population; re-activation of LTBI is a major driver of tuberculosis (TB) cases worldwide. In low-incidence TB countries, TB and LTBI are often disproportionately concentrated amongst foreign born individuals, with national programmes increasingly focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of LTBI in migrants and other high-risk groups to prevent future TB cases and meet global elimination targets. However, little is known about the success of these programmes in engaging migrants and ensuring treatment completion - a population who often face multiple barriers to accessing health care on arrival to the host country. Prior to this review we scoped the literature and found two relevant reviews on this topic (Sandgren et al., 2016 & Alsdurf et al., 2016) but which did not specifically focus on migrants and/or lacked formal meta-analyses, and one/both used earlier data pre 2000 that may be less relevant now to current policy. Other studies have reported on migrant-specific outcomes in LTBI programmes globally, but the focus is often on screening practices rather than outcomes and all evidence in this area has not yet been effectively consolidated.

Added value of this studyThis is the first systematic review and meta-analysis specifically exploring LTBI treatment initiation and completion among migrant populations. We report LTBI treatment outcome data on 31,598 migrants from the year 2000 onwards within 13 low-incidence countries (<10 cases per 100,000). The research provides robust insights into the proportion of individuals initiating and completing treatment, using meta-regression to explore heterogeneity. The data show that between 2000-2020, 69% of migrants testing positive for LTBI initiated treatment, and of those starting treatment, approximately 74% completed it. Amongst studies capturing data on both initiation and completion, 52% of LTBI positive migrants successfully initiated and completed. The data also indicate higher initiation and completion in more recent years (2010-2020) with renewed focus on this approach to TB control, and a trend toward more positive outcomes amongst migrants in programmes in the WHO European region. The data show that multiple complex factors impact on treatment outcomes in migrants, including patient demographics and health systems. The evidence was ambivalent with some studies demonstrating positive and detrimental outcomes associated with foreign-born status.

Implications of all the available evidenceDelivery of LTBI programmes will need to be strengthened to improve outcomes in migrants and meet targets to eradicate TB in low-incidence countries. Greater focus will need to be placed on engaging migrants more effectively in the clinic, understanding the varied reasons for migrants declining treatment when testing positive, and ensuring treatment adherence using innovative approaches that are mindful of and sensitive to the unique experiences of this group on arrival to the host country.

DesignA systematic review of original articles. Electronic searchers were carried out in the databases MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health and PsychINFO (from inception - Nov 2020).

Eligibility criteria for study selectionThe analysis included original peer-reviewed research which reported on attempts to develop and implement a health intervention for migrants using participatory approaches. We defined migrants as foreign-born individuals; studies using definitions demonstrably outside of this were excluded. Only articles reporting the full research cycle (inception, design, implementation, analysis, evaluation, dissemination) were included.

Data extractionInformation related to who was involved in research (migrants or other non-academic stakeholders), the research stage at which they were involved (inception, design, implementation, analysis, evaluation, dissemination), and how this involvement aligned with the core principles of participatory research - categorising studies as exhibiting active, pseudo, or indirect participation of migrants.

Results1793 publication were screened of which 28 were included in our analysis. We found substantial variation in the application of participatory research approaches: across 168 individual research stages analysed across the 28 studies, we recorded 46 instances of active participation of migrants; 30 instances of proxy participation; and 24 instances of indirect participation. Whilst all studies involved at least one non-academic stakeholder group in at least one stage of the research, just two studies exhibited evidence of active participation of migrants across all research stages.

ConclusionsThese data highlight important shortfalls in the inclusion of migrant groups in developing health interventions that affect their lives and suggest a more rigorous and standardised approach to defining and delivering participatory research is urgently needed to improve the quality of participatory research.

RegistrationThis review followed PRISMA guidelines and is registered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/2bnz5)

Strengths and LimitationsO_LIThis systematic review represents a robust and novel assessment of the applications of participatory approaches and principles to health intervention research with migrants.
C_LIO_LIThis review casts a critical lens over the application and outcomes of participatory approaches, conceptually focusing on the relationship between the methods used and the populations involved, and how this all relates to participatory principles.
C_LIO_LIThis review is limited by the varied and interchangeable use of participatory research terms within this field. The categorisations and terms we introduce may therefore be defined differently by others.
C_LIO_LIThis review is limited by the lack of clear and consistent reporting of participatory methods utilised; guidelines must be prepared and consistently adopted to improve transparency in all participatory research.
C_LIO_LIThis does not analyse or consider associations between participatory methods, and health or research outcomes; future research to understand any such associations is needed.

Prescribed footwear and orthoses have been used to prevent injury. The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to assess if prescribed prophylactic footwear or foot orthoses reduced lower extremity injury risk in military tactical athletes.

MethodsMEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, SportDiscus, and DTIC databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published at any time that compared foot orthoses or prescribed footwear (to include shock-absorbing insoles and socks) to a placebo intervention or a no-treatment control. Methodological quality was assessed and numbers of injuries, population at risk, and the duration of the study epoch were extracted and relative risk (RR) calculated. An omnibus meta-analysis was performed assessing all prescribed footwear and orthoses intervention studies, with subgroup analyses conducted on studies with similar interventions [i.e., basketball athletic shoes; athletic shoes (prescribed by foot type); foot orthoses; shock-absorbing insoles; socks; tropical combat boots].

ResultsOf 1,673 studies identified, 22 studies were included. Three of eight studies that employed orthoses demonstrated significantly reduced overuse injuries compared to no treatment controls (RR range: 0.34-0.68); one study showed neoprene insoles significantly decreased overuse injuries (RR: 0.75). There were no other significant effects in the individual studies, and no protective effects observed in the omnibus meta-analysis or in the component sub analyses.

ConclusionsPrescribed footwear and orthoses do not appear to have a prophylactic effect on lower quarter MSKI in military members and cannot be recommended at this time.",NA,medrxiv

Investigations of larger pediatric cohorts aimed at defining the microbiome state and associated metabolic patterns pre-transplant are needed.

MethodsWe sought to describe the pre-transplant stool microbiome in pediatric allogenic HCT patients at four centers. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolic profiling on pre-transplant stool samples. Samples were compared with normal age-matched controls and by clinical characteristics. We then explored associations between stool microbiome measurements and metabolite concentrations.

ResultsWe profiled stool samples from 88 pediatric allogeneic HCT patients, a median of 4 days before transplant. Pre-transplant stool samples differed from healthy controls based on indices of alpha diversity and in the proportional abundance of specific taxa and bacterial genes. Relative to stool from healthy patients, samples from HCT patients had decreased proportion of Bacteroides, Ruminococcaeae and genes involved in butyrate production, but were enriched for gammaproteobacterial species. No systematic differences in stool microbiome or metabolomic profiles by age, transplant indication or hospital were noted. Stool metabolites demonstrated strong correlations with microbiome composition.

DiscussionStool samples from pediatric allogeneic HCT patients demonstrate substantial dysbiosis early in the transplant course. As microbiome disruptions associate with adverse transplant outcomes, pediatric-specific analyses examining longitudinal microbiome and metabolome change are imperative to identify causal associations and to inform rational design of interventions.",NA,medrxiv

The aim of this study was to design, implement and evaluate a new suite of planetary health learning activities piloted by medical students for a range of medical professionals.

MethodsThe study consisted of three components: curriculum mapping, development of learning activities and evaluation. Curriculum mapping involved searching program learning outcomes using relevant search terms. Two learning activities were co-developed with medical students comprising of an e-learning component and an inquiry-based small group workshop presented to 99 2nd year students. Evaluation consisted of pre- and post-learning knowledge quizzes and a student feedback survey.

ResultsA total of 30 learning outcomes were identified with the majority located in the first two years of the four-year program. The overall evaluation response rate was 49.5%, and 19% completed the feedback survey. The mean pre- and post-lesson scores, respectively, were 7.09 (SD=1.84) and 9.53 (SD=1.69) out of a possible score of 12, increasing by 2.37 points on average (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-3.09). Overall, the new activities were rated as excellent/good by 84.2% of respondents. The e-learning module rated more highly as a meaningful learning experience than the workshop (89% v. 63.2%). The most common criticism was the length of time it took to complete the e-learning.

ConclusionStudents already had a good understanding of planetary health  facts and the e-learning lesson served to confirm, review and update their knowledge. Students embraced the opportunity to engage in interactive learning through the problem-solving group work activity. There is very little vertical alignment of environmental and climate issues across all four years of the medical program in our institution and a variety of learning approaches should be considered when revising the curriculum.",NA,medrxiv

Here, we assess the impact of an increased circulation of other respiratory viruses on the monitoring of positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 and interpretation of surveillance data.

MethodsUsing a multi-pathogen Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model formalizing co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory we assess how an outbreak of secondary virus may inflate the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests and affect the interpretation of COVID-19 surveillance data. Using simulation, we assess to what extent the use of multiplex PCR tests on a subsample of symptomatic individuals can support correction of the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positive during other virus outbreaks and improve surveillance quality.

ResultsModel simulations demonstrated that a non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic creates an artificial decrease in the observed percent positivity of SARS-CoV-2, with stronger effect during the growth phase, until the peak is reached. We estimate that performing one multiplex test for every 1,000 COVID-19 tests on symptomatic individuals could be sufficient to maintain surveillance of other respiratory viruses in the population and correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positive.

ConclusionsThis study highlights that co-circulating respiratory viruses can disrupt SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Correction of the positivity rate can be achieved by using multiplex PCR, and a low number of samples is sufficient to avoid bias in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.

SummaryCOVID-19 surveillance indicators may be impacted by increased co-circulation of other respiratory viruses delaying control measure implementation. Continued surveillance through multiplex PCR testing in a subsample of the symptomatic population may play a role in fixing this problem.",NA,medrxiv

Statements and reports typically group all mothers aged under 20 together. Some studies have examined the risk variations within this age group, and several child health outcomes have yet to be examined.

MethodsWe analyzed data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) collected between 2004 and 2018 in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia, on children born to mothers 25 years old or younger. We examined the association between maternal age at first birth and deaths of neonates, infants, under 5 years old, and stillbirths, using mixed effects logistic regression and adjusting for common demographic and health-seeking variables.

FindingsThe mortality rates at all early-life stages of children born to mothers aged <16 years, 16-17 years, and 18-19 years at first birth were about 2-4 times, 1.5-2 times, and 1.2-1.3 times higher, respectively, than among children born to mothers aged 23-25 in both regions. Absolute mortality rates decreased over time, but the risk gradient versus age remained similar across time periods, regions, and most child mortality endpoints. After adjustment for rural/urban residence and maternal education, in SSA in 2014-2018 having a mother under 16 (10-15) years old was associated with stillbirth odds ratio (OR) 3.71 [95% CI 2.50-5.51], neonatal mortality OR 1.92 [1.60-2.30], infant mortality OR 2.13 [1.85-2.46], and under-5 mortality OR 2.39 [2.13- 2.68], compared with first children of mothers aged 23-25 years. For the same time period in South Asia ORs were stillbirths 5.12 [2.85-9.20], neonatal mortality 2.46 [2.03-2.97], infant mortality 2.62 [2.22- 3.08], and under-5 mortality 2.59 [2.22-3.03]. Adjustment for additional risk factors did not affect the estimates substantially.

Acamprosate is a glutamatergic antagonist drug and GABA-agonist that could be used to control tinnitus due to its action on peripheral and central neurotransmission.

PurposeTo assess the effectiveness of acamprosate in the treatment of tinnitus.

Material and MethodsThis is a systematic review and we searched for randomized clinical trials linking acamprosate to tinnitus in six databases: Cochrane - Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL (2021), PUBMED (1966-2021), EMBASE (1974-2021), IBECS (1982-2021), QINSIGHT (2021) and SCOPUS (2021). Two researchers independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the studies.

ResultsTwo trials involving 121 patients were included. The methodological quality of these studies was low. Both studies evaluated as primary outcome the efficacy of acamprosate in improving tinnitus. The meta-analysis by random model resulted in no significant difference between the groups treated with acamprosate and placebo (RR = 3,69, 95% CI 0,87-15,62; p=0,08), considering tinnitus improvement. Conclusions: There is no evidence that acamprosate is effective for tinnitus treatment. We recommend new trials using rigorous methodology. Randomization and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response.

Heterozygosity of the A-112C and Ala64Thr SNPs was related to lower WHR in CMP individuals compared to wild type homozygotes (p<0.05). Meta-analysis in case-control studies showed no statistically significant odds ratios in different alleles across the four studied SNPs (p>0.05). Thus, we conclude that the studied SNPs could be associated with the most common CMP and their risk factors in some populations.",NA,medrxiv

Here, a novel strategy for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants using multiplex PCR coupled with MALDI-TOF MS was developed.

MethodsPlasmids carrying gene sequences containing 9 mutation types in 7 mutated sites (HV6970del, N501Y, K417N, P681H, D614G, E484K, L452R, E484Q and P681R) in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants were synthesized. Using the nucleic acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 nonvariant and a synthetic SARS-CoV-2-variant-carrying plasmid, a MALDI-TOF MS method based on the single-base mass probe extension of multiplex PCR amplification products was established to detect the above nine mutation types. The detection limit of this method was determined via the concentration gradient method. Twenty-one respiratory tract pathogens (9 bacteria, 11 respiratory viruses) and pharyngeal swab nucleic acid samples from healthy people were selected for specific validation. Sixteen samples from COVID-19 patients were used to verify the accuracy of this method.

ResultsThe 9 mutation types could be detected simultaneously by triple PCR amplification coupled with MALDI-TOF MS. SARS-CoV-2 and all six variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429, B.1.526, P.1 and B.1.617) could be identified. The detection limit for all 9 sites was 1.5x103 copies. The specificity of this method was 100%, and the accuracy of real-time PCR CT values less than 30 among positive samples was 100%. This method is open and extensible, and can be used in a high-throughput manner, easily allowing the addition of new mutation sites as needed to identify and track new SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge.

ConclusionsMultiplex PCR-MALDI-TOF MS provides a new detection option with practical application value for SARS-CoV-2 and its variant infection.

Key pointAn all-in-one SARS-CoV-2 variant identification method based on a multiplex PCR-MALDI-TOF MS system was developed. All of the SARS-CoV-2 variants can be identified based on 9 types of 7 mutated sites of RBD of spike protein using this method.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsBaseline serologies were performed among HCW from 23 Swiss healthcare institutions between June and September 2020, before the second COVID-19 wave. Participants answered weekly electronic questionnaires covering information about nasopharyngeal swabs (PCR/rapid antigen tests) and symptoms compatible with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Screening of symptomatic staff by nasopharyngeal swabs was routinely performed in participating facilities. We compared numbers of positive nasopharyngeal tests and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms between HCW with and without anti-nucleocapsid antibodies.

ResultsA total of 4818 HCW participated, whereof 144 (3%) were seropositive at baseline. We analysed 107820 questionnaires with a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Median number of answered questionnaires was similar (24 vs. 23 per person, P=0.83) between those with and without positive baseline serology. Among 2713 HCW with [&ge;]1 SARS-CoV-2 test during follow-up, 3/67 (4.5%) seropositive individuals reported a positive result (one of whom asymptomatic), compared to 547/2646 (20.7%) seronegative participants, 12 of whom asymptomatic (risk ratio [RR] 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.66).

We aimed to quantify aerosol concentration produced during different dental procedures. Where aerosol was detected, we assessed whether the aerosol size distribution from patient procedures was explained by the non-salivary contaminated instrument source, using phantom head controls. This study obtained ethical approval within the AERATOR grant. Patients were recruited consecutively, and written consent was obtained. Both an optical and an aerodynamic particle sizer were used to measure aerosol, attached to a 3D-printed polylactide funnel 22cm from the patients face. A range of periodontal, oral surgery and orthodontic procedures were captured using time-stamped protocols. High-fidelity phantom head control experiments for each procedure were performed, under the same conditions. Aerosol was measured for each procedure. Where aerosol was detected, phantom head control and patient procedure aerosol size distributions were compared, with the assumption that if the distributions were the same, aerosol detected from the patient could be explained by the instrument source. 41 patients underwent fifteen different dental procedures. For nine procedures, no aerosol was detected. Where aerosol was detected, the percentage of procedure time that aerosol was observed above background ranged from 12.7% for ultrasonic scaling to 42.9% for 3-in-1 air + water syringe. For ultrasonic scaling, 3-in-1 syringe use and surgical drilling, the aerosol size distribution matched the non-salivary contaminated instrument source. High and slow speed drilling produced aerosol from patient procedures which appear to have different size distributions from a phantom head control and so may pose a greater risk of (potentially infected) salivary contamination. Ultrasonic scaling does not appear to generate additional aerosol above that of the instrument itself and therefore does not increase the risk to dental teams, relative to the risk from being in close proximity to the patient.",NA,medrxiv

DesignSingle-centre, analytical, dynamic cohort study.

Participants2,701 adults ([&ge;]18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or clinico-radiological diagnosis of covid-19, who required hospital admission to covid-19 specific wards, between January 2020 and March 2021. There were 884 covid-19 admissions during the first wave (before 30 Jun 2020) and 1,817 during the second wave.

Outcome measuresin-hospital covid-19 associated mortality, ascertained from clinical records and Medical Certificate Cause of Death.

ResultsThe crude mortality rate was 25% lower during the second wave (2.23 and 1.66 deaths per 100 person-days in first and second wave respectively). However, after accounting for age, sex, dexamethasone, oxygen requirements, symptoms at admission and Charlson Comorbidity Index, mortality hazard ratio associated with covid-19 hospital admissions was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.26, 2.08) times higher in the second wave compared to the first.

ConclusionsAnalysis of covid-19 admissions recorded in St. Georges Hospital, shows a larger second epidemic wave, with a lower crude mortality in hospital admissions. Nevertheless, after accounting for other factors underlying risk of death for covid-19 admissions was higher in the second wave.

While some individuals remain nearly asymptomatic, others suffer from severe respiratory failure. It has been hypothesized that previous vaccinations for other pathogens, in particular tetanus, may provide protection against severe COVID-19.

MethodsWe made use of data on COVID-19 testing from 103,049 participants of the UK Biobank (mean age 71.5 years, 54.2% female), coupled to immunization records of the last ten years. Using logistic regression, covarying for age, sex, respiratory disease diagnosis, and socioeconomic status, we tested whether individuals vaccinated for tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis, differed from individuals that had only received other vaccinations on 1) undergoing a COVID-19 test, 2) the outcome of this test, and 3) whether they developed severe COVID-19.

ResultsWe found that individuals with registered diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations were less likely to develop severe COVID-19 than people who had only received other vaccinations (diphtheria OR=0.46, p=3.6x10-4; tetanus OR=0.50, p=5.8x10-4).

DiscussionThese results indicate that a history of diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations is associated with less severe manifestations of COVID-19. These vaccinations may protect against severe COVID-19 symptoms by stimulating the immune system. We note the correlational nature of these results, yet the possibility that these vaccinations may influence the severity of COVID-19 warrants follow-up investigations.",NA,medrxiv

Moreover, mathematical models have been developed that allow prediction of active cases following the temporal patterns of viral loads in wastewaters.

In this work, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 in rivers and irrigation canals in the Mezquital Valley, Hidalgo, an agricultural region where wastewater from Mexico City is distributed and used for irrigation. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we detected the virus in 6 out of 8 water samples from rivers, and 5 out of 8 water samples from irrigation canals. Notably, samples showed a general consistent trend of having the highest viral loads in the sites closer to Mexico City, indicating that this is the main source that contributes to detection. Using the data for SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the river samples, we generated a simplified transport model that describes the spatial patterns of dispersion of virus in the river. We suggest that this model can be extrapolated to other wastewater systems that require knowledge of spatial patterns of viral dispersion at a geographic scale. Our work highlights the need for improved practices and policies related to the use of wastewater for irrigation in Mexico and other countries.",NA,medrxiv

ObjectiveTo investigate associations between parental diagnoses of IBD and offspring autism and elucidate their underlying aetiology by conducting four complementary studies.

Design, Setting and Participants(1) Nationwide population-based cohort study using Swedish registers to examine associations between parental IBD diagnoses and autism diagnoses in offspring, (2) Linkage disequilibrium (LD)-score regression to estimate the genetic correlation between the phenotypes. (3) Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to investigate associations between maternal genetic liability to IBD and autism factor mean score in offspring. (4) Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess bidirectional causal links between genetic liability to IBD and autism.

ResultsObservational analyses provided evidence of an association between parental IBD diagnoses and offspring autism diagnosis in mutually adjusted models (maternal: OR= 1.32; 95% CI: 1.25 to 1.40; p<0.001; paternal: OR= 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.17; p=0.012; n=2 324 227, 52.3% male).

MR analyses provided evidence of a potential causal effect of genetic liability for IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, on autism (ORMR= 1.03; 95%CI: 1.01 to 1.06). There was little evidence to suggest a causal effect of genetic liability to autism on risk of IBD, or a genetic correlation between the two conditions.

Conclusions and relevanceTriangulating evidence from a nationwide register-based cohort study, genetic correlation, polygenic risk score analyses and MR, we found evidence of a potentially causal link between parental, particularly maternal, diagnoses and genetic liability to IBD and offspring autism.

Drawing from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in 10 states in the USA, we calibrated simple mathematical models of influenza transmission dynamics to data for virologically confirmed hospitalisations during the initial  spring wave. We then projected pandemic outcomes (cumulative hospitalisations) during the fall wave, and compared these projections with data. Model results show reasonable agreement for all states that reported a substantial number of cases in the spring wave. Using this model we propose a probabilistic decision framework that can be used to determine the need for pre-emptive measures such as postponing school openings, in advance of a fall wave.

However, the broad, clinical characterization of these NDD-CNVs in large population cohorts, especially of diverse ancestry, is relatively understudied. We characterized the clinical presentation of NDD-CNVs in the BioMe biobank, comprising [~]25,000 individuals across diverse ancestry, medical and neuropsychiatric clinical presentation, with a mean age of 50.3 years.

METHODSIndividuals within the BioMe biobank harboring NDD-CNVs were identified using a consensus of two CNV calling algorithms, based on whole-exome sequencing and genotype array data, followed by a series of novel, in-silico clinical assessments.

RESULTSThe overall prevalence of a set of 64 NDD-CNVs was calculated at [~]2.5%, with prevalence varying by locus, corroborating the presence of some relatively, highly-prevalent NDD-CNVs (i.e., 15q11.2 deletion/duplication, 2q13(NPHP1) deletion/duplication). An aggregate set of rare, NDD-CNVs were enriched for congenital disorders (OR=1.8, p-value=0.02) and major depressive disorders (OR=1.3, p-value=0.04) in multi-ancestry analyses, and major depressive-disorder in an African ancestry-stratified group (OR=1.8, p-value=0.01). In a meta-analysis of medical diagnoses (n=195 hierarchically-clustered diagnostic codes), an aggregated set of rare, NDD-CNVs was significantly associated with obstructive sleep apnea (Z-score=3.6 p=3.2x10-4). Further, an aggregated set of rare, NDD-CNVs was associated with increased body mass index (BMI) in a multi-ancestry analysis (Beta=0.14, p-value=0,04), and in Hispanic-stratified analyses (Beta=0.30, p-value=4.2x10-3). For 38 common serum laboratory tests, there was no identified association with an aggregate set of NDD-CNVs.

CONCLUSIONThe current analyses elucidated clinical features of individuals harboring NDD-CNVs, in a large-scale, multi-ancestry biobank, identifying enrichments for congenital disorders and major depressive disorder, as well as identifying associations with obesity-related phenotypes, obstructive sleep apnea and increased BMI. Future recall of individuals harboring NDD-CNVs will allow for further clinical assessments beyond the electronic health records (EHR) presently analyzed, including neurocognitive and neuroimaging outcomes.",NA,medrxiv

Here, we collected such measurements both before and during the pandemic in the same individuals, using both conventional and virtual reality-based techniques. We found that the size of personal space, and discomfort ratings in response to personal space intrusions, increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, in response to both real humans and virtual ""others"". Moreover, this increase in personal space requirements correlated with the perceived, not the actual, risk of being infected with COVID-19 - even in a virtual reality environment in which there was no possibility of infection.

DesignUsing a scoping review methodology, we searched the websites of each identified data source to determine if they require, suggest, or refer to lay summaries. Two reviewers extracted lay summary writing instructions from eligible data sources from Australia, USA, UK, Canada and New Zealand. Data sources were linked to the top 10 non-communicable diseases.

Main Outcome MeasuresUsing an inductive approach, we identified characteristics of lay summaries and lay summary writing instructions and extracted data on these characteristics. These characteristics are lay summary formats, audience, requirements, authorship and labels, and elements of lay summary writing instructions (e.g. word count/length). We also noted who was expected to write the lay summaries, whether they were mandatory or optional, and the terms used for to denote them.

ResultsThe websites of 526 data sources were searched. Of these, 124 published or mentioned lay summaries and 108 provided writing instructions. For lay summaries, most were in journals, written by the author of the published paper, and only half were mandatory. Thirty-three distinct labels for a lay summary were identified, the most common being ""graphical abstract"", ""highlights"" and ""key points"". From the lay summary writing instructions, the most common elements for written lay summaries referred to: structure (86%), content (80%) and word count/length (74%). The least common elements were readability (3%), use of jargon, acronyms and abbreviations (24%), and wording (29%). The target audience was unclear in 68 of 108 (63.0%) of lay summary instructions.

DiscussionAlthough we identified over 100 sources provided instructions for writing lay summaries, very few provided instructions related to readability, use of jargon, acronyms and abbreviations, and wording. Some instructions provided structured formats via subheadings or questions to guide content, but not all. Only half mandated the use of lay summaries.

ConclusionFor lay summaries to be effective, writing instructions should consider the intended audience, ideally incorporating consumer input into their development. Presently, lay summaries are likely to be inaccessible to many consumers, written at a high reading level, with jargon, acronyms and abbreviations. Ideally, all research articles will have an accompanying lay summary. Mandatory lay summaries, however, are of limited value without clear and thorough instructions to guide authors.

Reducing the biomechanical loading caused by hand movements could reduce the occurrence of such disorders. However, most participants recruited for past experimental studies had a certain level of typing skill, and differences in the biomechanical loading of those with different typing skills have not been examined. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between the movements of the wrist and finger joints and the loading on the forearm muscles and to clarify the differences between typists of different skill levels.

MethodsA 3D motion capture system measured wrist and index finger joint movements, and surface electromyography measured muscle activities for the right hand during a typing task. We compared wrist and finger joint movements and forearm muscle loading during typing, keystroke time, and key release time between skilled and unskilled typists.

FindingsSkilled typists move their wrists and fingers faster with less muscle activity during typing, the active tension of their finger flexor muscles during keystrokes are high, and they have higher mechanical stresses on the finger flexor tendons during keystrokes. Unskilled typists develop strategies to prevent excessive stiffness in their wrist joints when making keystrokes. They are expected to have a higher cumulative loading on the extensor muscles of the wrist during key release.

InterpretationBiomechanical loading in typing skill is different, which may make it possible to predict disability. This could provide information on the changes in physical parameters and environments to prevent disability.",NA,medrxiv

Trunk kinematics and posture were assessed using a 3D motion analysis system and a force plate. Fifteen healthy girls, fifteen AIS girls with left lumbar main curve and seventeen AIS girls with right thoracic main curve were compared. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate presumed differences between the three groups. This study showed kinematic and postural differences between mild AIS patients and controls such as static imbalance, a reduced range of motion in the frontal plane and a different kinematic strategy in lateral bending.

Concurrently, adjuvant chemotherapy is endorsed for luminal A-like disease with [&ge;]4 axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases. We aimed to estimate the proportion of patients with invasive lobular cancer (ILC) and invasive ductal cancer of no special type (NST) and 1-2 SLN metastases for whom cALND would indicate need of adjuvant chemotherapy.

MethodsPatients with ILC and NST histopathology undergoing primary surgery 2014-2017 were identified in the Swedish National Quality Breast Cancer register. After exclusion of patients with incongruent or missing data, 1886 patients who fulfilled the St. Gallen 2019 criteria for cALND omission were included in the study cohort.

ResultsPatients with ILC (n = 329) had a higher metastatic nodal burden and more often a luminal A-like subtype compared with NST patients (n = 1507). The prevalence of [&ge;] 4 ALN metastases was higher in ILC (31%) than in NST (15%), corresponding to an adjusted odds of 2.26 (95% CI 1.59-3.21). Luminal A-like breast cancers with [&ge;]4 ALN metastases were overrepresented in ILC cases (52/281 (19%)) compared to NST cases (43/1299 (3%)), P<0.001.

ConclusionsPatients with ILC more often had a luminal A-like breast cancer with [&ge;]4 ALN metastases compared with NST patients. Abstaining cALND in patients with luminal A-like ILC with 1-2 SLN metastases warrants future attention as it risks nodal understaging and hence undertreatment in one-fifth of these patients.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate outcomes of early versus late cholecystectomy after percutaneous cholecystostomy.

MethodsThe study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and MOOSE guidelines. Heterogeneity was measured using Q tests and I2 statistics. The random-effects model was used. We evaluated cholecystectomy performed at different periods after percutaneous cholecystostomy within 72 hours or later, within or after one week or percutaneous cholecystostomy, within 10 days or after 10 days, less than 2 weeks or more than 2 weeks, less than 4 weeks or more than 4 weeks, less than 8 weeks or more than 8 weeks as per literature.

ResultsSix studies including 18640 patients were included in the final analysis. There was no difference in overall complications within or after 72 hours cholecystectomy group, but mortality and biliary complications were significantly high in the less than 72 hours group (p=0.05 and 0.0002 respectively). There was no difference in mortality, overall complication, biliary tract complications in less than 1 week versus more than 1 week and less than 10 days versus more than 10 days group. Overall complications were significantly less in the less than 2 weeks group compared to the more than 2 weeks group. There was no difference in mortality and biliary tract complications between less than 2 weeks and more than 2 weeks group. Overall complication rate (risk ratio 0.67, p <0.0001), postoperative mortality (risk ratio 0.46, p=0.003), bile duct injury (risk ratio 0.62, p=0.01) was significantly less in earlier than 4-week group. Hospital stay was not significantly different between less than 4 weeks versus more than 4 weeks group. (Mean difference= -2.74, p=0.12). Ove all complication rates were significantly more in less than 8 weeks group. (Risk ratio 1.07, p=0.01). Hospital stay was significantly less in less than 8 weeks group. (Mean difference 0.87, p=0.01).

ConclusionEarly cholecystectomy preferably within 4 weeks after percutaneous cholecystostomy is preferable over late cholecystectomy.",NA,medrxiv

We take a novel approach to the study of contemporary selective pressure by examining which genetic variants are ""sustained"" in populations as mortality exposure declines. Specifically, we deploy a so-called ""regional GWAS"" that links the infant mortality rate (IMR) by place and year in the UK with common genetic variants among cohorts in the UK Biobank. These cohorts (born 1936-1970) saw a decline in IMR from above 65 per 1,000 to under 20 per 1,000, with substantial subnational variation and spikes alongside wartime exposures. Our results show several genome-wide significant loci, including LCT and TLR10/1/6, related to area-level cohort IMR exposure during gestation and infancy. Genetic correlations are found across multiple domains, including fertility, cognition, health behaviors, and health outcomes, suggesting an important role for cohort selection in modern populations.",NA,medrxiv

However, it remains unclear why retrospectively reported trauma confers a greater risk for poor outcomes. Investigating the heritable characteristics and environmental adversities associated with measures of self-reported trauma could increase understanding of this risk pathway to psychopathology.

MethodsOur sample included 3,963 unrelated individuals from the Twins Early Development Study. We tested whether polygenic scores for 21 psychiatric, cognitive, anthropometric and personality traits were associated with childhood emotional and physical abuse retrospectively self-reported in adulthood. To assess the presence of gene-environment correlation, we investigated whether these associations remained after controlling for composite scores of environmental adversity between birth and age 16.

ResultsRetrospectively self-reported childhood trauma was associated with polygenic scores for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), body mass index and risky behaviours. When composite scores of environmental adversity were included in one model, only associations with parent-reported environmental adversity in middle childhood, self-reported environmental adversity in early adolescence and the polygenic score for ASD remained significant.

ConclusionsRetrospective self-reports of childhood trauma are associated with heritable characteristics of the reporter. Genetic predisposition to ASD may increase liability to experiencing or interpreting events as traumatic. Associations between genetic predisposition for risky behaviour and high BMI with self-reported childhood trauma may be environmentally-mediated. Studies of the association between retrospectively self-reported childhood trauma and later life outcomes should consider that genetically-influenced reporter characteristics may confound associations, both directly and through gene-environment correlation.",NA,medrxiv

Government policy interventions have targeted poor households for cash and food transfers. It is important, however, to study the impact of the pandemic on consumption levels of non-poor in India, and in particular the middle class. In this paper, we aim to quantify the changes in consumption levels and inequality over time, across all groups of rural households in India.

MethodsWe analyze three rounds of COVID 19-related shock surveys between May and September 2020. These surveys cover rural households of six large states in India and are representative of more than 442 million (52% of Indias rural population).

FindingsIn the early phase of the pandemic, it was the bottom 40% of households that experienced the most severe decline in consumption. But as the pandemic deepened, consumption declined across all classes of households. Besides the poorest, it was particularly severe for the middle class (defined as 40%-80%). We also measure consumption inequality over time and find that the Gini coefficient of consumption distribution increased significantly.

InterpretationIn addition to focusing on poor households, policy responses to alleviate peoples sufferings would have to consider a more comprehensive boost to consumption and compensate for the reduced consumption among middle class families as well.

MethodsAn epidemiological scenario analysis was developed in order to simulate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Italian national healthcare system in 2021. Hospitalisations, ICU admissions and death rates were modelled based on 2020 data. We forecast the impact of the introduction of a primary prevention strategy on the national healthcare system by considering vaccine efficacy, availability of doses and potential population coverage over time.

ResultsIn the absence of immunisation, between 57,000 and 63,000 additional deaths are forecast in 2021. Based on the assumptions underlying the two epidemiological scenarios from the 2020 data, our model predicts that cumulative hospital admissions in 2021 will range from 3.4 to 3.9 million. The deployment of vaccine immunisation has the potential to control the evolution of 2021 infections and avoid from 60 to 67 percent of deaths compared to not vaccinating.

MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of literature published January 2020 - February 2021 and focused on the topic of QI at public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search was conducted on four bibliographic databases, in addition to a supplementary grey literature search using custom Google search engines and targeted website search methods.

Paradoxically, this population is least likely to be protected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as a result of disease- or treatment-related immunosuppression. Current data on vaccine responses in persons with lymphoid malignancies is limited.

PROSECO is a UK multi-centre prospective observational study evaluating COVID-19 vaccine immune responses in individuals with lymphoma. This early interim analysis details the antibody responses to first- and second-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), in 129 participants. Responses are compared to those obtained in healthy volunteers.

The key findings of this interim analysis are first, 61% of participants who are vaccinated during or within 6 months of receiving systemic anti-lymphoma treatment, do not have detectable antibodies despite two doses of vaccine. Second, individuals with curable disease such has Hodgkin (6/6) and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13/16) develop robust antibody levels to either first or second doses, when vaccinated > 6 months after treatment completion. Third, participants incurable, indolent lymphomas have reduced antibody levels to first and second vaccine doses, irrespective of treatment history. Finally, whilst there was no difference in antibody responses between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 in lymphoma participants, BNT162b2 induces 11-fold higher antibody responses than ChAdOx1 after the second dose in healthy donors.

These findings serve to reassure the community that individuals with treated Hodgkin and aggressive B-NHL can develop antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

We analyzed the monthly distribution of the genomic sequence data for SARS-CoV-2from India and correlated that with the epidemiological data for new cases and deaths, for the corresponding period of the second wave. Our analysis shows that the first indications of arrival of the second wave were observable by January, 2021, and by March, 2021 it was clearly predictable. B.1.617 lineage variants drove the wave, particularly B.1.617.2 (a.k.a. delta variant).

MethodsThis final analysis of the phase 1/2 portion includes 799 patients: 275 (group-1) and 524 (group-2). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo, 2400mg REGEN-COV, or 8000mg REGEN-COV, and characterized at baseline for endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (serum antibody-positive/negative). Efficacy was assessed in patients with a positive baseline RT-qPCR result; safety was assessed in all treated patients. Prespecified hierarchical analyses of virologic endpoints in group-2 were performed to confirm previously reported descriptive analyses from group-1. The proportion of patients with [&ge;]1 Covid-19-related medically-attended visit (MAV) through day 29 was assessed in group-1+2.

Precedent evidence suggests that deficiency of the element zinc can be associated with similar complications as well as impaired antiviral response.

Herein, beyond determining the zinc status, we explore the association between the plasma zinc concentration, the development of CRS, and the clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study in a tertiary university hospital (CUB-Hopital Erasme, Brussels). Hospitalized adult patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled within 72 hours of hospital admission.

As a surrogate endpoint for CRS, we assessed the presence and severity of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome, using an additive six-point clinical scale (cHIS) that we independently validated in the current study.

We defined the clinical outcomes as the length of hospitalization, the incidence of mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We recorded the outcomes with a follow-up of 90 days from hospital admission.

ResultsOne hundred and thirty-nine eligible patients were included between May 2020 and November 2020 (median age of 65 years [IQR, 54 to 77]).

Our cohorts mean plasma zinc concentration was 56.2 mcg/dL (standard deviation [SD], 14.8). The absolute majority of patients (96%) were zinc deficient (<80mcg/dL).

The mean plasma zinc concentration was lower in patients with CRS (cHIS [greater double equals] 2) compared to those without CRS (-5 mcg/dL; 95% CI, -10.5 to 0.051; p = 0.048).

We observed that the plasma zinc concentration is weakly but significantly correlated with the length of hospital stay (rho = -0.19; p = 0.022). However, the plasma zinc concentration was not significantly associated with mortality or morbidity.

ConclusionsMarkedly, an absolute majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are zinc deficient. We found no significant association between zinc plasma concentration and cHIS. We find a weak (reverse) correlation between plasma zinc concentration and the length of hospital stay, but not with mortality or morbidity.

As such, our findings do not support the role of zinc as a robust prognostic factor among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

We encourage further studies to explore the role of zinc as a biomarker for assessing the risk of developing a tissue-damaging CRS and predicting outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

It is a common bodily response in children and is typically a benign process that is self-limiting.

Past attempts at translating medical knowledge about fever and its management strategies into parent-friendly formats exist; however, parent misperceptions about definition and management persist despite these educational tools.

Our research team employs patient engagement techniques to develop resources for parents to enhance the uptake of complex medical knowledge. First, our research group conducts qualitative interviews and knowledge synthesis of the literature. Following analysis, salient themes are used to develop a script and skeleton for our videos and infographics, respectively. Employing this same process, this paper discusses the development and usability testing of two digital tools for fever. Prototypes for the video and infographic were tested by parents in urban and remote emergency department (ED) waiting rooms. A total of 58 surveys were completed by parents.

However, these findings have been challenged as none of the studies accounted for perinatal deaths.

ObjectiveTo determine whether the reduction in extremely preterm births, observed in Denmark during the COVID-19 lockdown, could be a result of an increase in number of perinatal deaths; and to assess the impact of extended COVID-19 restrictions on the prevalence of preterm birth and perinatal death.

DesignThe study is a nationwide Danish register-based prevalence proportion study using detailed data to capture all births (induced abortions were excluded) throughout Denmark. We assessed the prevalence of stillbirth, preterm birth, and early neonatal death.

SettingPopulation-based study

ParticipantsAll singleton pregnancies delivered in Denmark, between February 27, and September 30, 2015-2020. COVID-19 lockdown was studied in 31,164 births and the extended period of COVID-19 restrictions in 214,862 births.

ExposureCOVID-19 restrictions broadly (February 27, - September 30, 2020) or COVID-19 lockdown specifically (March 12, - April 14, 2020).

Main OutcomePrevalence of preterm births, stillbirths and early neonatal deaths across the periods under study.

ResultsThe extremely preterm birth rate was reduced (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.86) during the strict lockdown period, while perinatal mortality was not significantly different. During the extended period of restrictions, the extremely preterm birth rate was marginally reduced, and a significant reduction in the stillbirth rate (OR 0.69, 0.50 to 0.95) was observed. No changes in early neonatal mortality rates were found.

Conclusion and RelevanceStillbirth and extremely preterm birth rates were reduced in Denmark during the period of COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown, respectively, suggesting that aspects of these containment and control measures confer an element of protection. The present observational study does not allow for causal inference; however, the results support design of studies to ascertain whether behavioural or social changes for pregnant women may improve pregnancy outcomes.

FundingNone

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan changes in stillbirth and early neonatal mortality rates during the COVID-19 lockdown explain the reduction in extremely preterm birth seen in Denmark?

FindingsIn this nationwide register-based study that included data pertaining to 245,999 pregnancies, the statistically significant reduction in extremely preterm birth during the COVID-19 lockdown was confirmed. The stillbirth and early neonatal mortality rates were unchanged during lockdown, while the stillbirth rate was reduced over the extended period of COVID-19 restrictions.

MeaningThe reduction in extremely preterm births seen during the COVID-19 lockdown in Denmark is not a result of increased stillbirth or early neonatal death.",NA,medrxiv

However, this association can be affected by many correlates of these traits. Due to its large impact on human health, socioeconomic status (SES) could at least partially influence the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity. To estimate the independent effect of traits related to body size and SES on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study analyzing the effect of obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes.

MethodsApplying two-sample MR approaches, we evaluated the effects of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference, (HIP) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) studied in up to 234,069 participants from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium with respect to three COVID-19 outcomes: severe respiratory COVID-19 (5,101 cases vs. 1,383,241 controls), hospitalized COVID-19 (9,986 cases vs. 1,877,672 controls), and COVID-19 infection (38,984 cases vs. 1,644,784 controls) obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI). Finally, to test the effect of SES using multivariable MR methods, we analyzed genetic data related to self-reported household income (HI) information from 286,301 UK Biobank (UKB) participants.

ResultsBMI and WC were associated with severe respiratory COVID-19 (BMI: OR=1.68 p=0.0004; WC: OR=1.72, p=0.007) and COVID-19 hospitalization (BMI: OR=1.62, p=1.35e-06; WC: OR=1.62, p=0.0001). Also, HIP influenced hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=1.31, p=0.012) and COVID-19 infection (OR=1.18, p=0.002). Conversely, HI was associated with lower odds of severe respiratory COVID-19 (OR=0.57, p=0.011) and hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=0.71, p=0.045). Testing these effects in multivariable MR models, we observed that the effect of these obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes is not independent of SES effect assessed as HI.

ConclusionsOur findings indicate that low SES is a contributor to the observed association between body size and COVID-19 outcomes.",NA,medrxiv

Previous genomic studies have primarily focused on gene level differential expression to identify related molecular signatures and pathways, but the genome-wide effects of smoking on alternative isoform regulation and posttranscriptional modulation have not yet been described.

ResultsWe conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in whole-blood samples of 454 current and 767 former smokers in COPDGene Study. We assessed the association of current smoking with differential expression of genes and isoforms and differential usage of isoforms and exons. At 10% FDR, we detected 3,167 differentially expressed genes, 2,014 differentially expressed isoforms, 945 differentially used isoforms and 160 differentially used exons. Genes containing differentially used isoforms were enriched in biological pathways involving GTPase activity and innate immunity. The majority of these genes were not differentially expressed, thus not identifiable from conventional differential gene expression analysis. Isoform switch analysis revealed for the first time widespread 3' UTR lengthening associated with cigarette smoking, where current smokers were found to have higher expression and usage of isoforms with markedly longer 3' UTRs. The lengthening of 3' UTRs appears to be mediated through alternative usage of distal polyadenylation sites, and these extended 3' UTR regions are significantly enriched with functional sequence elements including adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich elements, microRNA and RNA-protein binding sites. Expression quantitative trait locus analyses on differentially used 3' UTRs identified 79 known GWAS variants associated with multiple smoking-related human diseases and traits.

ConclusionsSmoking elicits widespread transcriptional and posttranscriptional alterations with disease implications. It induces alternative polyadenylation (APA) events resulting in a switch towards the usage of isoforms with strikingly longer 3' UTRs in genes related to multiple biological pathways including GTPase activity and innate immunity. The extended 3' UTR regions are enriched with functional sequence elements facilitating post-transcriptional regulation of protein expression and mRNA stability. These findings warrant further studies on APA events as potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for smoking-related diseases.",NA,medrxiv

In immunocompromised persons after transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) the BKV high-rate replication is associated with haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) with a reported incidence of 17 %. Numerous studies of reconstitution of the immune system after HSCT have established the principal role of T cell effectors in the control of viral replication and reactivation. The value of pretransplant BKV-specific antibodies in transplanted patients for the protection from viral disease was long considered insignificant. We hypothesized that the status of BKV immunity prior to HSCT could provide evidence for the BKV tendency to reactivate and that examining the level of subtype-specific antibodies and T-cell response in individual patients could help to predict the risk of BKV reactivation and HC. Evaluation of the risk of HC in relation to pretransplant anti-BKV1,2,4 IgG levels together with clinical factors known before transplantation revealed that patients with ""medium"" anti-BKV IgG and significant clinical risk (SR) have a very significantly increased HC risk in comparison with the reference group of ""low"" anti-BKV IgG level and low clinical risk (LR) (P=0.0009). Analysis of pretransplant T cell immunity to BKV antigens VP1 and LTag has shown that magnitude of IFN-gamma T cell response inversely corelated with posttransplant DNAuria. We hypothesize that the control of BKV latency by BKV specific T cells before HSCT would be one of the factors that influence BKV reactivation after HSCT. Our study has shown that prediction using a combination of clinical and immunological pretransplant risk factors can help early identification of patients who are at risk of developing BKV disease after HSCT.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsTen focus groups were held with parents or guardians ( parents) of children who had not adhered to the referral for further care in Cross River State, Nigeria, in 2019. Data from verbatim transcripts were analysed deductively using topics from the interview guide plus  Other to capture unanticipated results. Analysts followed procedures for Qualitative Content Analysis plus a modified Framework Method to identify overarching themes and barriers that are both highly salient (most frequently mentioned) and relevant (discussed in at least half of all groups).

ResultsThree themes identified in the data are 1) modifiable barriers (key among them being parental beliefs and problems with the referral letter), 2) contextual factors (parents situation, attitudes towards children and beliefs about care) and 3) participants recommendations to improve the child eye care program (educate the general public and correct parents misconceptions). Many of the findings echoed those from previous studies conducted in both low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs).

ConclusionThis study went beyond identifying modifiable barriers to also identify contextual factors and what parents recommend be done to improve vision care for children in Cross River State, Nigeria. If acted on, these findings may increase acceptance and uptake of eye care services that can promote sustainability and spread of the program to other parts of Nigeria and/or Africa.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsGenomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood samples of TB patients (n=219; Manipur:139; Tripura: 60; Nagaland: 20). The TaqMan allelic discrimination assay and statistical tools were used to investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) patterns in NAT2, PXR, ABCB1, and GSTT1 genes.

ResultsIn the study population, ten distinct genotypes of the NAT2 gene and single variation in the PXR, ABCB1, and GSTT1 genes were identified. A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between rs1801280 and rs1799931 of the NAT2 gene. Majority of the study populations were intermediate (~46.1%), rest were either slow acetylators (~35.6%) or fast acetylators. Interestingly, ~55% of the TB patients in Tripura were slow acetylators and majority in Manipur and Nagaland were of intermediate acetylator genotypes. For all of the markers investigated, the population had a greater prevalence of ancestral alleles and genotypes. According to a combinational study of the genotypes linked to AT-DILI, ~26.1% of the population possessed the risk genotypes.

ConclusionThese TB patients from north eastern states of India were found as carriers of the ancestral alleles and genotypes. And the risk for AT-DILI during TB treatment is low. Expanding such studies with additional markers and larger sample sizes will be useful to generate precise population-specific pharmacogenomics details for efficient TB management.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed at an in-silico analysis of regulatory microRNA and their transcription factors (TF) for these inflammatory genes that may help to devise potential therapeutic strategies in the future.

MethodsThe cytokine regulating immune-expressed genes (CRIEG) was sorted from literature and the GEO microarray dataset. Their co-differentially expressed miRNA and transcription factors were predicted from publicly available databases. Enrichment analysis was done through mienturnet, MiEAA, Gene Ontology, and pathways predicted by KEGG and Reactome pathways. Finally, the functional and regulatory features were analyzed and visualized through Cytoscape.

ResultsSixteen CRIEG were observed to have a significant protein-protein interaction network. The ontological analysis revealed significantly enriched pathways for biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. The search performed in the MiRNA database yielded 10 (ten) miRNAs that are significantly involved in regulating these genes and their transcription factors.

ConclusionAn in-silico representation of a network involving miRNAs, CRIEGs, and TF which take part in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 has been elucidated. These regulatory factors may have potentially critical roles in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 and may be explored further to develop targeted therapeutic strategies and mechanistic validation.",NA,medrxiv

These missing or incomplete features can affect and limit the application of quantitative methods in pharmacovigilance for meta-analyses of data during randomized clinical trials. In this study, we implemented adaptive signal detection approaches to correct spurious association, hidden factors, and confounder misclassification when the covariates are unknown or unmeasured on medications affecting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially creating an increased risk of life-threatening outcomes in high-risk patients. We consider pulmonary ADE (pADE) profiles in a long-standing group of therapeutics, RAS-acting agents, in patients with hypertension associated with high-risk for COVID-19. Using these techniques, we confirmed our hypothesis that drugs from the same drug class could have very different pADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness. Following multiple filtering stages to exclude insignificant and noise-driven reports, we found that drugs from antihypertensives agents, urologicals, and antithrombotic agents (macitentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, selexipag, sildenafil, tadalafil, and beraprost) form a similar class with a significantly higher incidence of pADEs. Macitentan and bosentan were associates with 64% and 56% of pADEs, respectively. Because these two medications are prescribed in diseases affecting pulmonary function and may be likely to emerge among the highest reported pADEs, in fact, they serve to validate the methods utilized here. Conversely, doxazosin and rilmenidine were found to have the least pADEs in selected drugs from hypertension patients. Nifedipine and candesartan were also found by our signal detection methods to form a drug cluster, shown by several studies an effective combination of these drugs on lowering blood pressure and appeared an improved side effect profile in comparison with single-agent monotherapy.

Author SummaryUnderlying comorbidities continue to negatively affect COVID-19 patients. A recent focus has been on medications affecting RAS. Therefore, with the advent of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in high-risk patients with hypertension, identifying specific RAS medications with the lowest incidence of pADEs would be beneficial. For this purpose, we curated the FDA ADE database to search for information related to human pADEs. As part of post-marketing drug safety surveillance, state/federal regulatory agencies and other institutions provide massive collections of ADE reports, these large data-sets present an opportunity to investigate ADEs to provide patient management based on comparative population data analysis. The abundance and prevalence of ADEs are not always detectable during randomized clinical trials and before a drug receives FDA approval for use in the clinic, which may appear with more widespread use. This is especially true for specific agents or diseases since there are simply too few events to be assessed, even in a large clinical trial for side effect profiles of specific disease states. For this purpose, we employed a novel method identifying extraneous causes of differential reporting including sampling variance and selection biases by reducing the effect of covariates.",NA,medrxiv

The main treatment regimen currently in use requires a lumbar puncture as part of the diagnostic process to determine disease stage and hospital admission for drug administration. Fexinidazole is a new oral treatment for stage 1 and non-severe stage 2 human African trypanosomiasis. The World Health Organization has recently incorporated fexinidazole into its treatment guidelines for human African trypanosomiasis. The treatment does not require hospital admission or a lumbar puncture for all patients, which is likely to ease access for patients; however, it does require concomitant food intake, which is likely to reduce adherence. Here, we use a mathematical model calibrated to case and screening data from Mushie territory, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to explore the potential negative impact of poor compliance to an oral treatment, and potential gains to be made from increases in the rate at which patients seek treatment. We find that reductions in compliance in treatment of stage 1 cases are projected to result in the largest increase in further transmission of the disease, with failing to cure stage 2 cases also posing a smaller concern. Reductions in compliance may be offset by increases in the rate at which cases are passively detected. Efforts should therefore be made to ensure good adherence for stage 1 patients to treatment with fexinidazole and to improve access to passive care.",NA,medrxiv

ObjectiveTo assess the associations between health conditions diagnosed in primary care and the risk of incident AD over time.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData for 20,214 AD patients from the United Kingdom and 19,458 AD patients from France were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. For each AD case, a control was randomly assigned after matching for sex and age at dementia diagnosis. We agnostically tested the associations between 123 different ICD10 diagnoses extracted from health records and AD dementia, by conditional logistic regression. We focused on two time periods: 2 to 10 years vs. 0 to 2 years before the diagnosis of AD, to separate risk factors from early symptoms/comorbidities.

ExposuresWe considered all health conditions that had been recorded in more than 0.1% of visits per 1000 person-years in both cohorts, corresponding to 123 potential types of exposure.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresOdds ratios (ORs) for the association of AD with the various health conditions were calculated after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

ResultsTen health conditions were significantly associated with high odds ratios for AD when diagnosed 2 to 10 years before AD, in the British and French samples: major depressive disorder (OR 95% confidence interval (UK):1.23-1.46)), anxiety (1.25-1.47), reaction to severe stress (1.24-1.59), hearing loss (1.11-1.28), constipation (1.22-1.41), spondylosis (1.14-1.39), abnormal weight loss (1.33-1.63), malaise and fatigue (1.14-1.32), memory loss (6.65-8.76) and syncope and collapse (1.1-1.37). Depression was the first comorbid condition associated with AD, appearing at least nine years before the first clinical diagnosis of AD, followed by, anxiety, constipation and abnormal weight loss.

Conclusions and RelevanceThese results from two independent primary care databases provide new evidence on the temporality of risk factors and early signs of Alzheimers disease. These results could guide new dementia prevention strategies.",NA,medrxiv

Real world comparative data on immune response following vaccination or natural infection are rare.

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal observational study in employees at a secondary care hospital affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparisons were made about the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunglobulin G (IgG) antibody ratio after natural infection, or vaccination with one or two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2), or one dose of AstraZenca (Vaxzevria) vaccine.

ResultsWe found a 100% humoral response rate in participants after 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. The antibody ratio in participants with one dose BNT162b2 and Vaxzevria did not differ significantly to those with previous PCR-confirmed infection, whereas this was significantly lower in comparison to two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer. We could not identify a correlation with previous comorbidities, obesity or age within this study. Smoking showed a negative effect on the antibody response (p=0.006)

One approach to rapid testing might be to consider the olfactory capacities of trained detection dogs in order to develop a non-invasive, rapid and cheap mass detection approach, through the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The goal of this study was to determine the individual values of sensitivity and specificity of trained dogs when performing olfactory detection of COVID-19 on axillary sweat samples. Seven dogs were used to sniff a total of 218 samples (62 COVID-19 positive and 156 COVID-19 negative samples), based on a randomised and double-blinded protocol carried out on olfaction cone line-ups. To ensure a wide olfactory range as close as possible to operational conditions, the samples were retrieved from 13 different sites.

Sensitivities varied from 87% to 94% for 6 dogs, and were above 90% for 3 of them. Only one dog, whose sensitivity was 60%, was not selected to subsequently enter the operational stage. Specificities varied from 78% to 92%, with 6 dogs over 85% and 4 dogs over 90%.

Based on the calculated sensitivity and specificity for each dog, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated according to several prevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 scenarii, and were compared to PPV and NPV of an ""almost perfect"" diagnostic tool. For 6 out of the 7 dogs, and for a prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 lower or equal than 40%, the NPV of the dogs were virtually the same as the one of the ""almost perfect"" tool. Along with other studies on olfactory detection of COVID-19 by dogs these positive and encouraging results suggest that olfactory dogs may play an important part in mass COVID-19 pre-testing situations.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThe 10 council areas were a convenience sample. Council websites were examined for smokefree policies and a systematic attempt was made to identify the five largest pedestrian-only sites with permanent seating in each council area (10 sites each for two larger cities). Field visits were conducted to all selected sites.

ResultsSmokefree policies with components covering smokefree outdoor plazas/malls/boulevards were common (80%; 8/10 councils), albeit with some gaps (eg, around signage and vaping policy). A total of 60 relevant pedestrianised sites with permanent seating were identified and surveyed. Of these 63% were officially designated smokefree. Smokefree signage was only present in 15% (9/60) of all the sites and in 24% (9/38) of the designated smokefree sites.

Understanding the potential role of competitive displacement between vector species could inform both current insecticide-based vector control programmes and the development of future complementary interventions.

MethodsA systematic review was conducted to identify studies of insecticide-based vector control of Anopheles species in Africa that reported indices for absolute densities of vector species. After screening against inclusion, exclusion and risk of bias criteria, studies were assigned to three categories based on whether they showed population density changes involving decreases in two or more vector species (D), increases in two or more vector species (I), or increases in one vector species concomitant with decreases in another vector species (ID). Category ID studies could thus provide evidence consistent with the release of vector species from competition following the insecticide-based population suppression of Anopheles species.

ResultsOf 5,569 papers identified in searches, 30 were selected for quantitative and qualitative analysis. Nineteen studies were assigned to category D and 1 study to category I. Ten studies categorised as ID provided evidence ranging from weak to persuasive that release from competition could have contributed to changes in species composition. Category ID showed no statistical differences from category D for reductions in malaria transmission and levels of insecticide resistance, but did so for insecticide type, pyrethroids being associated with category ID. A qualitative assessment identified 5 studies that provided the most convincing evidence that release from competition could have contributed to changes in species composition.

ConclusionThis review identified evidence that insecticide-based reductions in the density of Anopheles species in Africa could facilitate the release of other vector species from competition. While it remains uncertain whether this evidence is representative of most entomological sequelae from the use insecticide-based vector control in the field, 5 studies provided persuasive evidence that insecticide use could lead, at least under some circumstances, to competitive release of non-targeted vector species. These results should inform current and future integrated vector management approaches to malaria control.",NA,medrxiv

This study assessed determinants of adherence to major coronavirus preventive behaviours, including demographics, attitudes and concerns, among Canadians during the first pandemic wave.

MethodsAs part of the iCARE study (www.iCAREstudy.com), we weighted data from two population-based, online surveys (April and June, 2020) of Canadian adults. Questions tapped into behaviour change constructs. Multivariate regression models identified determinants of adherence.

ResultsData from 6,008 respondents (51% female) were weighted for age, sex, and province. Awareness of government policies was high at both time points (80-99%), and adherence to prevention behaviours was high in April (87.5%-93.5%) but decreased over time, particularly for avoiding social gatherings (68.1%). Adherence was worse among men, those aged 25 and under, and those currently working. Aligned with the Health Beliefs Model, perceptions of the importance of prevention behaviours and the nature of peoples COVID-19-related concerns were highly predictive of adherence. Interestingly, health and social/economic concerns predicted better adherence, but having greater personal financial concerns predicted worse adherence at both time points.

ConclusionAdherence to COVID-19 prevention behaviours was worse among men, younger adults, and workers, and deteriorated over time. Perceived importance of prevention behaviours measures and health and social/economic concerns predicted better adherence, but personal financial concerns predicted worse adherence. Results have implications for tailoring policy and communication strategies during subsequent pandemic waves.",NA,medrxiv

Biallelic mutations in the MUTYH gene cause the autosomal recessive condition known as MUTYH-associated adenomatous polyposis and increase colorectal cancer risk. However, the cancer risk associated with germline variants in individuals carrying only one MUTYH defective allele is controversial and based on studies involving few samples. Here, we described a comprehensive investigation of monoallelic deleterious MUTYH carriers among approximately 10,400 patients across 33 different tumor types and more than 117 thousand samples of normal individuals. Our results indicate MUTYH deficiency in heterozygosity can lead to tumorigenesis through a mechanism of Loss Of Heterozygosity (LOH) of the functional MUTYH allele. We confirmed that the frequency of damaging MUTYH monoallelic variant carriers is higher in individuals with cancer than in the general population, though its frequency is not homogeneous among tumor types. We also demonstrate that MUTYH related mutational signature is elevated only in those patients with loss of the functional allele. We also find that MUTYH characteristic base substitution (C>A) increases stop codon generation and we identify key genes affected during tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we propose that deleterious germline monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers are at a higher risk of developing tumors, especially those types with frequent LOH events, such as adrenal adenocarcinoma.",NA,medrxiv

DesignNationwide prospective observational cohort study.

SettingData collected from 169 out of 351 childrens hospitals in Germany between March 18, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and comparison with the Statutory Notification System.

Participants1,501 children and adolescents up to 19 years of age with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections who were admitted to childrens hospitals and subsequently reported to the COVID-19 registry of the German Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (DGPI).

Main outcome measuresAdmission to intensive care, in-hospital.

ResultsAs compared to the information in the statutory notification system, up to 30% of all children and adolescents hospitalized in Germany during the study period were reported to the DGPI registry. Median age was three years (IQR, 0-12), with 36% of reported cases being infants. Although roughly half of patients in the registry were not admitted to the hospital due to their SARS-CoV-2 infection, 72% showed infection-related symptoms during hospitalization. Preexisting comorbidities were present in 28%, most commonly respiratory disorders, followed by neurological, neuromuscular, and cardiovascular diseases. Median length of hospitalization was five days (IQR 3-10). Only 20% of patients received a SARS-CoV-2-related therapy. Infants were less likely to require therapy as compared to older children. Overall, 111 children and adolescents were admitted to intensive care units (ICU). In a fully adjusted model, patient age, trisomy 21, coinfections and primary immunodeficiencies (PID) were significantly associated with intensive care treatment. In a bivariate analysis, pulmonary hypertension, cyanotic heart disease, status post (s/p) cardiac surgery, fatty liver disease, epilepsy and neuromuscular impairment were statistically significant risk factors for ICU admission.

ConclusionOverall, a small proportion of children and adolescents was hospitalized in Germany during the first year of the pandemic. The majority of patients within our registry was not admitted due to COVID-19 suggesting an overestimation of the disease burden even in hospitalized children. Nevertheless, a large proportion of children and adolescents with confirmed COVID-19 reported in Germany could be captured. This allowed for detailed assessment of overall disease severity and underlying risk factors in our cohort. The main risk factors for COVID-19 disease associated intensive care treatment were older patient age, trisomy 21, PIDs and coinfection at the time of hospitalization.

This spike in unhealthy air quality in Philadelphia has affected the health of the citys population. Unhealthy air quality can be exacerbated by asbestos, which has been found in many Philadelphia elementary schools. Although asbestos usage is now highly regulated, it can still be found in consumer products and construction material today. Among the many factors contributing to asthma onset and other lung diseases, air pollution and dangerous air particles such as asbestos are important contributors. Children in these asbestos infected schools became exposed and ultimately sick which led to their schools eventual closure. Due to childrens immature and more vulnerable airways, this exposure may have led to increasing cases of respiratory distress.

MethodsThis research study analyzed publicly available asbestos data from Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) reports from four Philadelphia elementary schools (Laura H. Carnell, James J. Sullivan, Clara Barton, and Thomas M. Peirce) from 2016-2018 to further understand the influence of asbestos particles on asthma in children. Secondary data analysis determined the levels of asbestos contamination in each elementary school and the severity of the condition for each school. This was compared to childrens asthma prevalence during the selected time period.

ResultsAsbestos was mainly found in the 2-6 inch pipe insulation and tiles within each school. Between 0.06 and 1.18% asbestos damage was found in 2-6inch pipe insulation in schools closed for asbestos abatement. An r2 of 0.9997 was found when comparing the 206inch pipe damage percentage and the newly friable material found in each school. Thomas M. Pierce Elementary was determined to be the highest concern according to the analysis of the AHERA reports.

ConclusionChildren exposed to asbestos in elementary schools, and with a predisposition to asthma, were more likely to suffer from respiratory distress, due to the multiple contributing environmental factors.",NA,medrxiv

An antibiotic resistance threat of critical priority is the epidemic ST258 strain of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Here, we studied the spread of resistance among ST258 to an antibiotic of last resort, colistin, by tracking its evolution across 21 U.S. long-term acute care hospitals over the course of a year. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that a significant cost was associated with colistin resistance in most cases, as resistance emergence was common but resistance variants were rarely transmitted. The high cost of resistance was further supported by the observation that several of the resistance variants that were transmitted had acquired secondary variants that reverted the strain to colistin susceptibility. The exceptions to the general pattern of instability associated with colistin resistance were two large clusters of resistant strains in one ST258 clade II sublineage (clade IIB) present across 11 of the 12 sampled Southern California hospitals. Quantification of transmission fitness in the healthcare environment using time-scaled haplotypic density indicated that while resistant isolates from other clades were less fit than their susceptible counterparts, clade IIB resistant isolates were more fit. Overlaying patient clinical data suggested that the increased fitness of colistin-resistant clade IIB isolates is in part driven by a lineage defining variant that increased clade IIBs association with patient subpopulations who were more likely to be treated with colistin. These results show that a favorable genetic background and sustained selective pressure led to the emergence and spread of a colistin-resistant ST258 sublineage across a regional healthcare network. More broadly, these findings highlight the utility of integrating pathogen genomic and corresponding clinical data from regional healthcare networks to detect and understand the origin and dissemination of antibiotic resistance threats.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsIn total, 2782 patients were enrolled between March 2020 and December 2020, including 2106 patients (first wave) and 676 patients (second wave) in the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The first-wave patients were divided into two groups with 1474 patients used to train the model, and 632 to validate it. The 676 patients in the second wave were used to test the model. Age, 17 blood analytes and Brescia chest X-ray score were the variables processed using a Random Forests classification algorithm to build and validate the model. ROC analysis was used to assess the model performances. A web-based death-risk calculator was implemented and integrated within the Laboratory Information System of the hospital.

ResultsThe final score was constructed by age (the most powerful predictor), blood analytes (the strongest predictors were lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte %, Ferritin std and Monocyte %), and Brescia chest X-ray score. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained for the three groups (training, validating and testing) were 0.98, 0.83 and 0.78, respectively.

We hypothesized that convalescent plasma would improve outcomes for critically ill adult patients with Covid-19.

METHODSIn an ongoing adaptive platform trial, critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19, defined as receiving intensive care-level organ support, were randomized to open-label convalescent plasma or not (i.e., control group). The primary end point was organ support-free days (i.e., days alive and free of ICU-based organ support) up to day 21. The primary analysis was a Bayesian cumulative logistic model with predefined criteria for superiority or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support-free days, or both.

RESULTSThe convalescent plasma intervention was stopped after pre-specified criteria for futility were met. At that time, 1084 participants had been randomized to convalescent plasma and 916 to no convalescent plasma (control). The median organ support-free days were 0 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) for the convalescent plasma group and 3 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) days for the control group. The median adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.97 (95% credible interval 0.83 to 1.15) and posterior probability of futility (OR < 1.2) was 99.4% for convalescent plasma compared to control. In-hospital mortality was 37.3% (401/1075) in convalescent plasma group, and 38.4% (347/904) in controls. The observed treatment effects were consistent across primary and secondary outcomes.

As the virus spreads and evolves it acquires new mutations that could have important public health consequences, including higher transmissibility, morbidity, mortality, and immune evasion, among others. Ideally, we would like to quickly identify new mutations that could confer adaptive advantages to the evolving virus by leveraging the large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. One way of identifying adaptive mutations is by looking at convergent mutations, mutations in the same genomic position that occur independently. The large number of currently available genomes, more than a million at this moment, however precludes the efficient use of phylogeny-based techniques. Here, we establish a fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach for the early warning and surveillance of emerging adaptive mutations of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our method relies on a novel topological tool for the analysis of viral genome datasets based on persistent homology. It systematically identifies convergent events in viral evolution merely by their topological footprint and thus overcomes limitations of current phylogenetic inference techniques. This allows for an unbiased and rapid analysis of large viral datasets. We introduce a new topological measure for convergent evolution and apply it to the complete GISAID dataset as of February 2021, comprising 303,651 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 isolates taken from patients all over the world since the beginning of the pandemic. A complete list of mutations showing topological signals of convergence is compiled. We find that topologically salient mutations on the receptor-binding domain appear in several variants of concern and are linked with an increase in infectivity and immune escape. Moreover, for many adaptive mutations the topological signal precedes an increase in prevalence. We demonstrate the capability of our method to effectively identify emerging adaptive mutations at an early stage. By localizing topological signals in the dataset, we are able to extract geo-temporal information about the early occurrence of emerging adaptive mutations. The identification of these mutations can help to develop an alert system to monitor mutations of concern and guide experimentalists to focus the study of specific circulating variants.",NA,medrxiv

We investigated whether LTL is associated with risk of frailty, a multidimensional syndrome of decline that affects multiple systems and predisposes to adverse health outcomes.

MethodsIn a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 441,781 UK Biobank participants (aged 40-70 years), with complete data on LTL and frailty indicators. We defined frailty as the presence of at least three of five indicators: weaker grip strength, slower walking pace, weight loss in the past year, lower physical activity, and exhaustion in the past two weeks. We evaluated association of LTL with frailty using adjusted (chronological age, sex, deprivation, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, multimorbidity) multinomial and ordinal regression models. We used Mendelian randomisation (MR), using 131 genetic variants associated with LTL, to assess if the association of LTL with frailty was causal.

FindingsFrail participants (4{middle dot}6%) were older (median age difference (95% CI): 3 (2{middle dot}5; 3{middle dot}5) years), more likely to be female (61%), and had shorter LTL (-0{middle dot}13SD vs 0{middle dot}03SD) than non-frail. In adjusted analyses, both age and LTL were associated with frailty (OR=1{middle dot}03 (95%CI: 1{middle dot}02-1{middle dot}04) per year of older chronological age; 1{middle dot}10 (1{middle dot}08; 1{middle dot}11) per SD shorter LTL). Within each age group (40-49, 50-59, 60-69 years) the prevalence of frailty was about 33% higher in participants with shorter (-2SD) versus longer telomeres (+2SD). MR analysis showed an association of LTL with frailty that was directionally consistent with the observational association, but not statistically significant.

InterpretationInter-individual variation in LTL is associated with the risk of frailty independently of chronological age and other risk factors. Our findings provide evidence for an additional biological determinant of frailty.

FundingThe UK Medical Research Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the British Heart Foundation (MRC grant: MR/M012816/1) funded our measurements of LTL in UK Biobank. The funders had no role in study design; the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; the writing of the report; and the decision to submit the paper for publication.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTelomere length has been proposed as a biomarker of biological age. Shorter leucocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with higher incidence of several age-associated diseases, spanning multiple body systems, and with lower life expectancy. However, the association of shorter LTL with frailty, a multidimensional syndrome of decline across multiple systems, is inconclusive. We searched PubMed using the terms ""telomere length AND frailty"" in the title, abstract, or text with no language restrictions. This search identified 50 papers published before 30 November, 2020. Of these, three systematic reviews and/ or meta-analyses of modest size (five to nine studies, with total n<10,000) and 11 original research articles reported on associations between telomere length and frailty. These small-scale studies, primarily in older individuals, do not support an independent association between shorter LTL and higher risk of frailty.

Added value of this studyOur large-scale population-based study, involving over 441,000 participants, provides strong evidence that shorter LTL is associated with higher risk of both pre-frailty and frailty even after adjustment for chronological age and other established determinants of frailty, namely, age, sex, alcohol intake, smoking, obesity, deprivation and multimorbidity. Within each age group (40-49, 50-59, 60-69 years) the prevalence of frailty was about 33% higher in participants with shorter (-2SD) versus longer telomeres (+2SD). Part of the association of shorter LTL with higher risk of frailty may be due to the association in aggregate of LTL with diseases. Findings using genetic variants associated with LTL as instruments were directionally consistent with the observational association, but not statistically significant.

Implications of all the available evidenceShorter LTL is associated with frailty independent of chronological age and several other risk factors. The observation that risk of frailty associated with shorter LTL is proportionately similar across the age range of 40-70 years suggests that shorter LTL acts through a mechanism beyond just accelerating the impact of chronological ageing on risk of frailty.",NA,medrxiv

Among people aged 30-69, HRs reached 8.47 (8.01 to 8.95) among more-disabled females and 5.42 (5.18 to 5.68) for more-disabled males. Sequential adjustment for residence type, geography, socio-demographics, and health conditions partly explained the associations, indicating that a combination of these factors contributed towards the increased risk.

ConclusionDisabled people in England had markedly increased risk of mortality involving COVID-19 compared to non-disabled people and should be prioritised within the pandemic response.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsA sub-study on influenza vaccine co-administration was conducted as part of the phase 3 randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373. The first [~]400 participants meeting main study entry criteria and with no contraindications to influenza vaccination were invited to join the sub-study. After randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive NVX-CoV2373 (n=217) or placebo (n=214), sub-study participants received an age-appropriate, licensed, open-label influenza vaccine with dose 1 of NVX-CoV2373. Reactogenicity was evaluated via electronic diary for 7 days post-vaccination in addition to monitoring for unsolicited adverse events (AEs), medically-attended AEs (MAAEs), and serious AEs (SAEs). Influenza haemagglutination inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG assays were performed. Vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed. Comparisons were made between sub-study and main study participants.

FindingsSub-study participants were younger, more racially diverse, and had fewer comorbid conditions than main study participants. Reactogenicity events more common in the co-administration group included tenderness (70.1% vs 57.6%) or pain (39.7% vs 29.3%) at injection site, fatigue (27.7% vs 19.4%), and muscle pain (28.3% vs 21.4%). Rates of unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, and SAEs were low and balanced between the two groups. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune response, while a reduction in antibody responses to the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was noted. Vaccine efficacy in the sub-study was 87.5% (95% CI: -0.2, 98.4) while efficacy in the main study was 89.8% (95% CI: 79.7, 95.5).

InterpretationThis is the first study to demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with seasonal influenza vaccines. The results suggest concomitant vaccination may be a viable immunisation strategy.

FundingThis study was funded by Novavax, Inc.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles published from December 2019 until 1 April 2021 with no language restrictions for the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""vaccine"", ""co-administration"", and ""immunogenicity"". There were no peer-reviewed publications describing the simultaneous use of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and another vaccine. Several vaccine manufacturers had recent publications on phase 3 trials results (Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology). Neither these publications nor their clinical trials protocols (when publicly available) described co-administration and they often had trial criteria specifically excluding those with recent or planned vaccination with any licenced vaccine near or at the time of any study injection.

Added value of this studyImmune interference and safety are always a concern when two vaccines are administered at the same time. This is the first study to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity profile and clinical vaccine efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with a seasonal influenza vaccine.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study provides much needed information to help guide national immunisation policy decision making on the critical issue of concomitant use of COVID-19 vaccines with influenza vaccines.",NA,medrxiv

Despite its high mutational burden, HGSC is relatively refractory to checkpoint immunotherapy, suggesting that additional features of the cancer and its interactions with the immune system remain to be understood. Natural killer (NK) cells may contribute to HGSC control, but the role(s) of this population or its subsets in this disease are poorly understood.

MethodsWe used a TMA containing duplicate treatment-naive tumors from 1145 patients with HGSC and a custom staining panel to simultaneously measure macrophages, T cells and NK cells, separating NK cells based on CD16a expression. Using pathologist-validated digital pathology, machine learning, computational analysis and Pearsons correlations, we quantitated infiltrating immune cell density, co-infiltration and co-localization with spatial resolution to tumor region. We compared the prognostic value of innate, general, and adaptive immune cell ""neighborhoods"" to define characteristics of HGSC tumors predictive for progression-free survival and used flow cytometry to define additional features of the CD16adim NK cell subset.

ResultsNK cells were observed in >95% of tumor cores. Intrastromal localization of CD16alow and CD16ahigh NK cells was associated with shorter and longer progression-free survival, respectively. CD16ahigh NK cells most frequently co-localized with T cells and macrophages; their proximity was termed an ""adaptive"" neighborhood. We find that tumors with more area represented by adaptive immune cell neighborhoods corresponded to superior progression free survival. In contrast, CD16alow NK cells did not co-infiltrate with other immune cell types, and expressed the ectonucleotidases, CD39 and CD73, which have been previously associated with poor prognosis in patients with HGSC.

ConclusionsProgression-free survival for patients with HGSC may be predicted by the subset of NK cells within the tumor infiltrate (i.e. CD16ahigh vs. CD16alow). NK cell subtypes were associated predictable co-infiltrating and co-localizing leukocyte subsets, suggesting that their presence and activity may influence, or be influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Our data suggest that immunotherapeutic strategies for HGSC should consider the constitution of NK cell subsets and may benefit from mobilizing and activating CD16high NK cells.",NA,medrxiv

Understanding support needs and access to support among people bereaved at this time is crucial to ensuring appropriate bereavement support infrastructure.

AimTo investigate grief experiences, support needs and use of formal and informal bereavement support among people bereaved during the pandemic.

DesignBaseline results from a longitudinal survey. Support needs and experiences of accessing support are reported using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of free-text data.

Setting/Participants711 adults bereaved in the UK between March-December 2020, recruited via media, social media, national associations and community/charitable organisations.

ResultsHigh-level needs for emotional support were identified. Most participants had not sought support from bereavement services (59%, n=422) or their GP (60%, n=428). Of participants who had sought such support, over half experienced difficulties accessing bereavement services (56%, n=149)/GP support (52%, n=135). 51% reported high/severe vulnerability in grief; among these, 74% were not accessing bereavement or mental-health services. Barriers included limited availability, lack of appropriate support, discomfort asking for help, and not knowing how to access services. 39% (n=279) experienced difficulties getting support from family/friends, including relational challenges, little face-to-face contact, and disrupted collective mourning. The perceived uniqueness of pandemic bereavement and wider societal strains exacerbated their isolation.

ConclusionsPeople bereaved during the pandemic have high levels of support needs alongside difficulties accessing support. We recommend increased provision and tailoring of bereavement services, improved information on support options, and social/educational initiatives to bolster informal support and ameliorate isolation.

Key statementsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about the topic?C_ST_ABS- Features of pandemic bereavement, such as traumatic death experiences, exacerbate family distress and add to the complexity of grief.
- In pre-pandemic times most people mainly relied on the informal support of friends and family to cope with their bereavement, but an estimated 40% required more formal therapeutic support from bereavement or mental health services.
- Bereaved people experience difficulties getting the support that they need from bereavement services and their social networks.


What this paper adds- Participants had high level needs for emotional support, especially dealing with/expressing feelings, with 51% experiencing high or severe vulnerability in grief; however, 74% of this group were not accessing formal bereavement service or mental health support.
- Most participants had not tried to access bereavement services, for reasons such as lack of appropriate support, discomfort in asking for help and uncertainty of how to access services; of the 41% who tried, 56% experienced difficulties such as long waiting lists or ineligibility.
- A substantial proportion of people (39%) reported difficulties accessing support from friends and family; reduced in-person contact affected the perceived quality of support and disrupted collective mourning practices, whilst the wider social difficulties of the pandemic compounded feelings of isolation.


Implications for policy and practice- Further investment in the provision of tailored bereavement support is needed to meet the diverse needs and backgrounds of bereaved people, including support that is culturally and crisis/context competent, and group-based support for those with shared experiences and characteristics.
- To raise awareness of support options, information on grief and bereavement services should be provided proactively following a death and made available in online and community settings, with GPs and other primary care providers better resourced to signpost to appropriate support.
- Following compassionate communities approaches, expanded provision of informal community-based support and activities could help with isolation, whilst longer-term educational and societal initiatives are needed to bolster community support for people experiencing death, dying and bereavement.",NA,medrxiv

The need incentivizes stakeholders to develop border control strategies that fully evaluate health risks if mandatory quarantines are lifted. In this study, we have employed a computational approach to investigate the contact tracing integrated policy in different border reopening scenarios in Hong Kong, China. Built on a modified SEIR epidemic model with a 30% vaccination coverage, the results suggest that scenarios with digital contact tracing and quick isolation intervention can reduce the infectious population by 92.11% compared to those without contact tracing. By further restricting the inbound population with a 10,000 daily quota and applying moderate-to-strong community non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), the average daily confirmed cases in the forecast period of 60 days can be well controlled at around 9 per day (95% CI: 7-12). Two main policy recommendations are drawn from the study. First, digital contact tracing would be an effective countermeasure for reducing local virus spread, especially when it is applied along with a moderate level of vaccination coverage. Second, implementing a daily quota on inbound travelers and restrictive community NPIs would further keep the local infection under control. This study offers scientific evidence and prospective guidance for developing and instituting plans to lift mandatory border control policies in preparing for the global economic recovery.",NA,medrxiv

However, in whom the effects may be prolonged is less clear.

AimsTo investigate the prevalence, incidence, prognosis, and risk factors for depression and anxiety reported in a UK cohort over three distinct periods in the pandemic in 2020.

MethodAn online survey was distributed to a UK community cohort (n=3097) at three points: April (baseline), July-September (T2) and November-December (T3). Participants completed validated measures of depression and anxiety on each occasion and we prospectively explored the role of socio-demographic factors and psychological factors (loneliness, positive mood, perceived risk of and worry about COVID-19) as risk factors.

ResultsDepression (PHQ-9 means - baseline: 7.69, T2: 5.53, T3: 6.06) and anxiety scores (GAD-7 means -baseline: 6.59, T2: 4.60, T3: 4.98) were considerably greater than pre-pandemic population norms. Women reported greater depression and anxiety than men. Being younger, having prior mental health disorders, more negative life events due to COVID-19, as well as greater loneliness and lower positive mood at baseline were significant predictors of poorer mental health outcomes.

ConclusionThe negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has persisted to some degree. Younger people and individuals with prior mental health disorders were at greatest risk. Easing of restrictions might bring the opportunity for a return to social interaction, which could mitigate the risk factors of loneliness and positive mood.",NA,medrxiv

DesignCase-referent analysis of a secondary data set

SettingNHS Trusts in England

ParticipantsPseudonymised data on 959,356 employees who were continuously employed by NHS trusts during 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2020

Main Outcome MeasuresTrends in the burden of sickness absence due to mental ill health from 2019 to 2020 according to demographic, regional and occupational characteristics.

ResultsOver the study period, 164,202 new sickness absence episodes for mental ill health were recorded in 12.5% (119,525) of the study sample. There was a spike of sickness absence for mental ill health in March-April 2020 (899,730 days lost) compared with 519,807 days in March-April 2019; the surge was driven by an increase in new episodes of long-term absence and had diminished by May/June 2020. The increase was greatest in those aged >60 years (227%) and among employees of Asian and Black ethnic origin (109%-136%). Among doctors and dentists the number of days absent declined by 12.7%. The biggest increase was in London (122%) and the smallest in the East Midlands (43.7%); the variation between regions reflected the rates of Covid-19 sickness absence during the same period.

ConclusionAlthough the Covid-19 epidemic led to an increase in sickness absence attributed to mental ill health in NHS staff, this had substantially declined by May/June 2020, corresponding with the decrease in pressures at work as the first wave of the epidemic subsided.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study of LTCF managers for 12 consecutive weeks from May 5, 2020. We developed and pre-tested a 46-item questionnaire based on WHO IPC guidance that included multiple-choice and dichotomous questions as well as an open-ended question on the main difficulties encountered by the facility in tackling the pandemic. Using a global adherence score based on the adoption of 20 recommendations, we classified preparedness as (1) excellent for LTCFs following [&ge;]14 recommendations, (2) good for those following 10-13 recommendations, and (3) poor for those following <10 recommendations. LTCF size was established as small, medium, and large according to a 2-step cluster analysis of the number of residents as a continuous variable. We used descriptive statistics and chi-square tests at a 5% significance level.

ResultsOf 362 facilities included in the study, 308 (85.1%) adhered to 14 or more recommendations; 3 were classified as poorly adherent. Regarding LTCF size, we found a lower adherence to screening visitors for COVID-19 signs and symptoms (p=0.037) and to isolating patients until they have 2 negative laboratory tests (p=0.032) in larger facilities than in medium and small facilities.

ConclusionsPreparedness for mitigating COVID-19 in Brazilian LTCFs was considered excellent for most of the proposed recommendations, regardless of LTCF size. Difficulties and problems with infrastructure and/or resident care were much less commonly reported than those related to maintenance of a sufficient stock of materials, workforce management, and financial distress.",NA,medrxiv

Early modeling work projected a massive outbreak was likely after an introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the camps. Despite this, only 317 laboratory-confirmed cases and 10 deaths were reported through October 2020. While these official numbers portray a situation where the virus has been largely controlled, other sources contradict this, suggesting the low reported numbers to be a result of limited care seeking and testing, highlighting a population not willing to seek care or be tested. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates from similar a timeframe in India (57%) and Bangladesh (74%) further sow doubt that transmission had been controlled. Here we explore multiple data sources to understand the plausibility of a much larger SARS-CoV-2 outbreak among the Rohingya refugees.

MethodsWe used a mixed approach to analyze SARS-CoV-2 transmission using multiple available datasets. Using data from reported testing, cases, and deaths from the World Health Organization (WHO) and from WHOs Emergency Warning, Alert, and Response System, we characterized the probabilities of care seeking, testing, and being positive if tested. Unofficial death data, including reported pre-death symptoms, come from a community-based mortality survey conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM),) in addition to community health worker reported deaths. We developed a probabilistic inference framework, drawing on these data sources, to explore three scenarios of what might have happened among the Rohingya refugees.

ResultsAmong the 144 survey-identified deaths, 48 were consistent with suspected COVID-19. These deaths were consistent with viral exposures during Ramadan, a period of increased social contacts, and coincided with a spike in reported cases and testing positivity in June 2020. The age profile of suspected COVID-19 deaths mirrored that expected. Through the probability framework, we find that under each scenario, a substantial outbreak likely occurred, though the cumulative size and timing vary considerably. In conjunction with the reported and suspected deaths, the data suggest a large outbreak could have occurred early during spring 2020. Furthermore, while many mild and asymptomatic infections likely occurred, death data analyzed suggest there may have been significant unreported mortality.

ConclusionsWith the high population density, inability to home isolate adequately, and limited personal protective equipment, infection prevention and control in the Rohingya population is extremely challenging. Despite the low reported numbers of cases and deaths, our results suggest an early large-scale outbreak is consistent with multiple sources of data, particularly when accounting for limited care seeking behavior and low infection severity among this young population. While the currently available data do not allow us to estimate the precise incidence, these results indicate substantial unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 transmission may have occurred in these camps. However, until serological testing provides more conclusive evidence, we are only able to speculate about the extent of transmission among the Rohingya.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe collected patient data from 2014 to 2020 from our computerized patient record system. We performed HPV assays using the ROCHE 4800 system. The COBAS HPV assay detects HPV 16, HPV 18, and 12 other HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68). We organized cytology results and Hr-HPV assays with Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel for analysis.

ResultsA total of 9437 cervical specimens were co-tested. High-grade cytology lesions (HSIL or higher and ASC-H) were overwhelmingly positive for Hr-HPV (94.1% and 87.2%, respectively). Low-grade cytology lesions (LSIL and ASC-US) were positive for Hr-HPV in lower percentages (72.6% and 54.9%, respectively). Hr-HPV testing had a sensitivity of 91.3%, a specificity of 93.1%, a positive predictive value of 16.4%, and a negative predictive value of 99.8% for detecting high-grade cytology lesions. Hr-HPV testing had a lower performance for detecting low-grade cytology lesions. Ten (10) cases had high-grade cytology and negative Hr-HPV test. Nine out of ten (9/10) of these patients showed no dysplasia (6) or low-grade dysplasia (3) on subsequent biopsy. Overall, 14.4% of tests were positive for Hr-HPV. The highest positive Hr-HPV test rates were in the second and eighth decades of life, 25.1% and 22.0%, respectively. In women over age 30, HPV types 16 and 18 were present in 11.7% and 6.4% of tests, respectively. Other HPV types were present in 82.3% of tests.

ConclusionsHr-HPV testing has high performance for detecting high-grade cytology lesions. We believe our findings are in accordance with recent studies and guidelines that recommend primary Hr-HPV testing as the preferred screening method. The percentage of positive Hr-HPV tests and rates for age and HPV types 16 and 18 in our womens veteran population suggest similar HPV prevalence to that of the general US population.",NA,medrxiv

We hypothesized that molecular markers of tubular injury could diagnose COVID-19 associated kidney damage and predict its clinical course.

MethodsThis is a prospective cohort study of 444 consecutive COVID-19 patients (43.9% females, 20.5% African American, 54.1% Latinx) in Columbia Universitys Emergency Department at the peak of the New York pandemic (March-April 2020). Urine and blood were collected simultaneously at admission (median time of day 0, IQR 0-2 days) and within 1 day of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in 70% of patients. Biomarker assays were blinded to clinical data.

ResultsUrinary NGAL (uNGAL) was strongly associated with AKI diagnosis (267{+/-}301 vs. 96{+/-}139 ng/mL, P=1.6x10-10). uNGAL >150ng/mL had 80% specificity and 75% sensitivity to diagnose AKIN stage 2 or higher. uNGAL quantitatively predicted the duration of AKI and outcomes, including death, dialysis, shock, and longer hospital stay. The risk of death increased 73% per standard deviation of uNGAL [OR (95%CI): 1.73 (1.29-2.33), P=2.8x10-4] and was independent of baseline SCr, co-morbidities, and proteinuria [adjusted OR (95%CI): 1.51 (1.10-2.11), P=1.2x10-2]. Proteinuria and uKIM-1 also indicated tubular injury but were not diagnostic of AKI. Typically, distal nephron segments transcribe NGAL, but in COVID-19 biopsies with widespread acute tubular injury (ATI), NGAL expression overlapped KIM-1 in proximal tubules.

MethodsWe developed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 viral load trajectories over the course of infection to assess the effectiveness of quarantine and testing strategies. We consider the utility of pre and post-flight Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and lateral flow testing (LFT) to reduce transmission risk from infected arrivals and to reduce the duration of, or replace, quarantine. We also estimate the effect of each strategy relative to domestic incidence, and limits of achievable risk reduction, for 99 countries where flight data and case numbers are estimated.

ResultsWe find that LFTs immediately pre-flight are more effective than PCR tests 3 days before departure in decreasing the number of departing infectious travellers. Pre-flight LFTs and post-flight quarantines, with tests to release, may prevent the majority of transmission from infectious arrivals while reducing the required duration of quarantine; a pre-flight LFT followed by 5 days in quarantine with a test to release would reduce the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected traveller compared to symptomatic self-isolation alone, Rs, by 85% (95% UI: 74%, 96%) for PCR and 85% (95% UI: 70%, 96%) for LFT, even assuming imperfect adherence to quarantine (28% of individuals) and self-isolation following a positive test (86%). Under the same adherence assumptions, 5 days of daily LFT testing would reduce Rs by 91% (95% UI: 75%, 98%).

ConclusionsStrategies aimed at reducing the risk of imported cases should be considered with respect to: domestic incidence, transmission, and susceptibility; measures in place to support quarantining travellers; and incidence of new variants of concern in travellers origin countries. Daily testing with LFTs for 5 days is comparable to 5 days of quarantine with a test on exit or 14 days with no test.",NA,medrxiv

Wastewater surveillance can rapidly obtain population-level estimates of disease transmission, and we leverage freedom from disease principles to make use of non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to estimate the probability that a community is free from SARS-CoV-2 transmission. From wastewater surveillance of 24 treatment plants across upstate New York beginning in May 2020, we observed a reliable limit of detection of 0.3--0.5 cases per 10,000 population. No COVID-19 cases were reported 40% of the time following a non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and cases were less than 1 daily case per 10,000 population 97% of the time following non-detection. Trends in the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater correlate with trends in COVID-19 incidence and test positivity ({rho}>0.5), with the greatest correlation observed for active cases and a three-day lead time between wastewater sample date and clinical test date. Wastewater surveillance can cost-effectively demonstrate the geographic extent of the transmission of emerging pathogens, confirming that transmission is absent or under control and alerting of an increase in transmission.

Methods Each free-text line from the June 2020 version of the NICE COVID-19 search strategy was categorised as Critical, High, Medium, Low or Zero priority, according to the number of results and their relevance to NICE. Five search options were devised and tested by combining them with a search for drug treatments. The two prioritised options were compared to the COVID-19 Limit available in Ovid. New subject headings were tested and added. The selected option was refined to make the strategy simpler to use.

Both lavage fluid and traditional nasopharyngeal swab were analyzed by real-time PCR and antigenic test.

ResultsA total of 49 positive subjects were enrolled in the study. Results of the analysis on lavages and nasopharyngeal swabs were concordant for 48 cases, regardless of the antigenic and molecular test performed. RT-PCR resulted weakly positive at swab in one case and negative at lavage fluid. Among the control group (44 subjects) nasopharyngeal swab and lavage fluid analyses returned a negative result. Sensitivity of the molecular test based on nasal lavage fluid, compared to traditional nasal swab, was 97.7%, specificity was 100%, and accuracy was 98.9%, with high agreement (Cohens k, 0.978).

ConclusionNasal and nasopharyngeal lavages resulted to be highly reliable and well tolerated. A larger series is needed in order to confirm these results. This approach may potentially represent a valid alternative to the traditional swab method in selected cases.",NA,medrxiv

The bibliographic databases Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed and Web of Science were searched from inception to 23 May 2021 for randomized controlled trials, case-control and cohort studies included. For continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively, we calculated the mean difference using the inverse-variance method and the risk ratio with the Mantel-Haenszel method. In all, ten trials with 705 patients were included. Confirmed by meta-analysis, ketamine didnt increase the prevalence of PTSD by a risk ratio (95 % CI) of 0.86 (0.61 to 1.20), p = 0.38 in 3 trials with 503 patients. Evidence of a difference was found in the PTSD-scales taken between ketamine and control during short durations (months), with a mean difference (95 % CI) of 2.45 (1.33 to 3.58), p < 0.001 in three trials with 65 patients. Another evidence is shown in chronic PTSD (years), with a mean difference (95 % CI) of -3.66 (-7.05 to -0.27), p = 0.03 in three trials with 91 patients. Sub-group analysis underlined the increased benefit of ketamine administration for those in whom the procedure was more than one week in the chronic PTSD group. The adoption of ketamine for the short duration of PTSD is in avoidance, but for chronic PTSD is recommended and, in the opinion of the authors, should be considered as a new therapy in view of its potential to ameliorate arousal, avoidance and dissociative symptoms, neuroticism after trauma needing more animal research and clinical trials.",NA,medrxiv

Older and more sensitive hosts should be vaccinated first to minimize the disease burden. But what are the evolutionary consequences of targeted vaccination? We clarify the consequences of different vaccination strategies through the analysis of the speed of viral adaptation measured as the rate of change of the frequency of vaccine-escape mutations. We show that a vaccine-escape mutant is expected to spread faster if vaccination targets individuals which are likely to be involved in a higher number of contacts. We also discuss the pros and cons of dose-sparing strategies. Because delaying the second dose increases the proportion of the population vaccinated with a single dose, this strategy can both speed-up the spread of the vaccine-escape mutant and reduce the cumulated number of deaths. Hence, slowing down viral adaptation may not always be the optimal vaccination strategy. We contend that a careful assessment of the consequences of alternative vaccination strategies on both (i) the speed of adaptation and (ii) the mortality is required to determine which individuals should be vaccinated first.",NA,medrxiv

To test whether a short course of treatment was safe in COVID-19 patients, we treated 10 hospitalized, oxygen requiring, non-critically ill patients with CSA at a starting dose of 9mg/kg/day. Five patients experienced adverse events, none were serious, and transaminitis was most common. No subject enrolled in this trial required intensive care unit (ICU)-level care and all patients were discharged alive from the hospital. Further, CSA treatment was associated with significant reductions in serum cytokines and chemokines important in COVID-19 hyper-inflammation, including CXCL10.

This longitudinal cohort study aims to recruit a cohort of NHS healthcare workers, conducting surveys at regular intervals to provide evidence about the prevalence of symptoms of mental disorders, investigate associated factors such as occupational contexts and support interventions available.

Methods and AnalysisAll staff, students, and volunteers working in each of the 18 participating NHS Trusts in England will be sent emails inviting them to complete a survey at baseline, with email invitations for the follow up surveys being sent 6 and 12 months later. Opening in late April 2020, the baseline survey collects data on demographics, occupational and organisational factors, experiences of COVID-19, a number of validated measures of symptoms of poor mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder; PTSD), and measures of constructs such as resilience and moral injury. These regular surveys will be complemented by in-depth psychiatric interviews with a select sample of healthcare workers. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted, to gain deeper understanding of the support programmes used or desired by staff, and facilitators and barriers to accessing such programmes.

Ethics and DisseminationEthical approval for the study was granted by the Health Research Authority (reference: 20/HRA/210, IRAS: 282686) and local Trust Research and Development approval. Cohort data are being collected via Qualtrics online survey software, are pseudonymised and held on secure University servers. Participants are aware that they can withdraw from the study at any time, and there is signposting to support services for any participant who feels they need it. Only those consenting to be contacted about further research will be invited to participate in the psychiatric and qualitative interview components of the study. Findings will be rapidly shared with NHS Trusts to enable better support of staff during the pandemic, and via academic publications in due course.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThe longitudinal cohort design addresses the lack of long-term data on this population, and the current predominance of cross-sectional evidence available.
C_LIO_LIThe availability of Trust HR data means we will be able to calculate response rates, and weight the data appropriately.
C_LIO_LIThe diagnostic interview component of the study will allow us to establish the true prevalence of mental disorders, which can be inflated by the measures used in most mental health and wellbeing cohort studies.
C_LIO_LIThe qualitative interviews will give deeper insight into the support programmes that HCWs find most helpful, and provide ideas for Trusts to improve their offer to staff.
C_LIO_LIThe three components of the study give breadth and depth lacking in much of the mental health and wellbeing research currently available, but there is a risk of over-burdening already stretched HCWs.

MethodsIn a prospective post-vaccination cohort study with up to 5 months follow-up we studied outpatient dialysis and kidney transplant patients and respective healthcare teams. Outcomes were anti S1/S2 antibody response to vaccine or infection and infection rate during followup.

Results175 dialysis patients (40% women, 65{+/-}15 years), 252 kidney transplant patients (33% women, 54{+/-}14 years) and 71 controls (65% women, 44{+/-}14 years) were followed. Three months or longer after vaccination we detected anti S1/S2 IgG antibodies in 80% of dialysis patients, 44% of transplant recipients and 100% of controls, whereas respective rates after infection were 94%, 75% and 100%. Predictors of non-response were age, diabetes, history of cancer, lower lymphocyte count and lower vitamin-D levels. Factors associated with lower titers in dialysis patients were modality (hemodialysis vs peritoneal) and serum ferritin levels. In transplant patients, hypertension and higher calcineurin or mTOR inhibitor drug levels were linked with diminished antibody response. Vaccination associated with fewer subsequent infections (HR=0.23, p<0.05). Moreover, higher antibody titers associated with fewer events, HR 0.41 for each unit increased in log10titer (p<0.05).

ConclusionsDialysis patients, and more so kidney transplant recipients, mounted delayed and reduced antibody response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, and lesser humoral response associated with more infections. Measures to identify and protect non-responsive patients are urgently required.

SignificanceReports on the humoral immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with end stage renal disease are scarce, and association with subsequent COVID-19 morbidity is unknown. In this cohort study that included 175 patients treated with dialysis, 252 kidney transplant recipients and 71 control volunteers, the proportion achieving an antibody response was time- and group-dependent, reaching 80%, 44% and 100% at 3 months post prime inoculation. Personal history of vaccination, positive antibody responses and antibody titers associated with significantly lower risk of COVID-19 infection. Thus, in patients with end stage renal disease, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing may be warranted after vaccination, to identify non-responders at higher risk for disease.",NA,medrxiv

Maintenance dialysis patients (MDP) are at higher risk of both exposure and mortality from the disease. Efficacy and security of BNT162b2 vaccine is well documented for the general population, but not in MDP, particularly in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This study aims to compare humoral response between hemodialysis (HD) and PD patients.

Materials and MethodsObservational prospective study including MDP on HD or PD program from a Portuguese middle-sized Nephrology Center, who received BNT162b2 vaccine. Specific anti-Spike IgG was measured as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) on two separate occasions: 3 weeks after the first dose and 3 weeks after the second. The two modality groups were compared both for absolute value and number of non-responders (NR) after both inoculations. Demographic data was also compared.

ResultsOf 73 patients enrolled, 67 were eligible for the final study: 42 HD and 25 PD patients. PD group developed significantly higher antibody titers in both inoculations: first dose with Med 5.44 vs 0.99 (p<0.01) and second dose with Med 170.43 vs 65.81 (p<0.01). HD status was associated with NR after the first dose (Phi=0.383; p<0.01), but not after the second (p=0.08). Age, Charlson comorbidity index and dialysis vintage were lower in the PD group (p<0.01; p=0.02; p<0.01, respectively).

ConclusionThis study demonstrated a better humoral response to immunization with BNT162b2 in PD patients, when compared to HD patients, after each of the two recommended inoculations. Both groups showed substantial humoral response after just one dose of the vaccine. Older age and higher comorbidity burden may explain the relative immunogenicity deficit, probably in a superior degree comparing with age matched healthy population.

MethodsPatients older than 15 years and followed-up at least for 6 months, between October 2015 and August 2020, with one motor function scale (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, HFMSE; Revised Upper Limb module, RULM) in five referral centers were included. Bedside functional scales (Egen Klassification, EK2; Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale, ALSFRS-R) were also collected when available. Correlations and regression models were performed to evaluate the construct validity. The monthly slopes of change were used to calculate their responsiveness.

ResultsThe study included 79 SMA patients, followed up for a mean of 16 months. All scales showed strong or very strong correlations with each other. A floor effect in motor function scales was found in weakest patients (HFMSE < 5 and RULM<10), and a ceiling effect in stronger patients (with HFMSE >55 and RULM > 35), when compared with other scales. ALSFRS-R (B=0.72) showed a strong discriminating ability between walkers, sitters, and non-sitters, and HFMSE (B=0.86) between walkers and sitters. The responsiveness was overall low, although in treated patients a moderate responsiveness was found for ALSFRS-R and HFMSE in walkers (0.69 and 0.61 respectively), and for EK2 in sitters (0.65) and non-sitters (0.60).

ConclusionsThis study shows the validity in SMA adult patients of commonly used scales. Overall, bedside functional scales showed some advantages over motor function scales, although all scales showed low responsiveness in untreated patients.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsAvailable studies from PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and gray literature including reference list and conference abstracts were searched from December 1, 2019, through April 12, 2021. We included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that reported risk factors of contracting COVID-19 or its outcome in patients with MS on univariate or multivariate regression analyses.

ResultsOut of the initial 2719 records and 1553 conference abstracts, a total of 20 studies were included. Factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility were reported in 11 studies and risk factors for infection outcomes were discussed in 10. History of contact with an infected is strongly suggested as a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility. Other factors that could be associated with contracting infection are younger age, relapsing course, and anti-CD20 agents. The evidence suggests that increasing age, greater MS severity, treatment with anti-CD20 agents, previous use of corticosteroids, and specific comorbidities (obesity and coronary artery disease) could be independently associated with worse infection outcomes. Male sex is likely to be a risk factor for more severe disease. The black or African American race was reported as a possible risk factor.

ConclusionDue to a paucity of research and methodological issues, no risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes neither be confirmed nor excluded. Further large studies are needed to address factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.",NA,medrxiv

UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021 hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit.

We used structural and functional brain scans from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left insula.

We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19 vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|>3). Our findings thus consistently relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being mis-interpreted as disease effects.

MethodsDecision tree models were constructed to study two decision-making scenarios, 1) TORS vs. definitive radiation therapy (RT), and 2) TORS vs. definitive chemo(radiation) therapy (CRT) based on well-established objective and subjective swallowing-function instruments, MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN), and clinician-rated Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) that measure swallowing-related toxicity pre-therapy, 3-6 months (short-term), and 18-24 months (long-term) after therapy for five treatment cohorts (RT, CRT, TORS, TORS with adjuvant RT, and TORS with adjuvant CRT). The optimal treatment was sought as a function of postoperative extranodal extension (ENE) and/or positive margin (PM) that can trigger the adjuvant therapy. 2D heatmaps were constructed indicating the thresholds of postoperative events likelihoods required for TORS or definitive therapy to become the optimal treatment. Additionally, a risk calculation model was developed to quantify the risk associated with TORS in the settings that estimation of postoperative complications likelihoods may not be available.

ResultsUnder the first scenario and for short-term measures, MDADI and MDASI instruments indicate the superiority of definitive therapy to TORS at all times, while DIGEST required a maximum of 40% likelihood for both ENE and PM events to indicate TORS as the optimal treatment. For 18-24 months measures, MDASI indicated TORS as the optimal treatment; however, MDADI- and DIGEST-based long-term measures indicated threshold likelihoods of 90% and 25%, respectively, for TORS to remain the optimal treatment. For short-term outcomes, TORS resulted in higher toxicity even when the likelihood associated with postoperative tumor resection margin (TM) are extremely low. For higher probability of postoperative TM, all instruments indicated high risk associated with TORS (>83%). For long-term swallowing-related toxicity, TORS remained the optimal therapy independent from the probability of postoperative TM based on MDASI instrument. However, MDADI-based measure assigned a high risk to TORS (>86%) when postoperative TM is extremely likely. DIGEST-based measures indicated a very high risk associated with TORS independent from the postoperative TM likelihood (>91%).

Under the second scenario (TORS vs. definitive CRT), Both MDASI- and MDADI-based short-term measures indicated TORS as the optimal therapy independent from postoperative ENE/PM events. However, according to the DIGEST-based measure, definitive RT remained the optimal therapy when the probability of postoperative ENE and PM events exceed 80%. In this case, TORS was the optimal therapy if both events were not relatively likely (<55%). The same result was observed for MDADI and MDASI instruments for long-term measures indicating TORS as the optimal therapy independent from postoperative PM or ENE events. However, the DIGEST measure indicated that TORS is the optimal therapy only if the likelihood of both events are very low (<20%). When the postoperative TM is very unlikely (<10%), all instruments indicated TORS as the optimal therapy based on short-term outcomes. However, when the postoperative TM is extremely likely (>90%), DIGEST-based measures demonstrated the superiority of definitive CRT once the likelihood of postoperative ENE or PM is, at least, 60%. Long-term measures indicated higher sensitivity to postoperative TM likelihood with both MDADI- and DIGEST-based measures indicating a moderately high risk (> 60%) with TORS causing higher clinician-rated swallowing toxicity compared to definitive CRT when postoperative TM is extremely likely.

ConclusionThe current study using decision modeling shows proof of concept that in the absence of reliable estimation of postoperative ENE/PM events concurrent with significant postoperative positive margins (i.e., more than 2mm) that can trigger adjuvant therapy, the overall toxicity level incurred by OPSCC patients undergoing TORS may become more severe compared to patients receiving non-surgical treatments thus advocating definitive (C)RT protocols. The results further demonstrated that, when available, the likelihoods of postoperative events triggering postoperative adjuvant therapy must be incorporated when choosing the optimal treatment plan for eligible patients.",NA,medrxiv

Defective proteins related to lysosomal macromolecule catabolism are known to cause a broad range of lysosomal storage diseases. It is unclear, however, if mutations in genes in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway can cause syndromic disease. Here we show that SLC7A14, a transporter protein mediating lysosomal uptake of cationic amino acids, is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate mechanosensitive hair cells and highly expressed in lysosomes of mammalian cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and retinal photoreceptors. Autosomal recessive mutation of SLC7A14 caused loss of IHCs and photoreceptors, leading to pre-synaptic auditory neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa in mice and humans. Loss of function mutation altered protein trafficking and disrupted lysosomal homeostasis, resulting in dysregulation of basal autophagy and progressive cell degeneration.

After discharge, these patients often have extensive health care needs, but out-of-pocket burden for this care is poorly described. Using national data, we assessed out-of-pocket spending during the 90 days after COVID-19 hospitalization among privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients.

METHODSIn May 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the IQVIA PharMetrics(R) Plus for Academics Database, a national de-identified claims database. Among privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March-June 2020, we calculated mean out-of-pocket spending for care within 90 days of discharge. To contextualize results, we repeated analyses for patients hospitalized for bacterial pneumonia.

RESULTSAmong 1,465 COVID-19 patients included, 516 (35.2%) and 949 (64.8%) were covered by private insurance and Medicare Advantage plans. Among these patients, mean (SD) post-discharge out-of-pocket spending was $ 534 (1,045) and $ 680 (1,360); spending exceeded $ 2,000 for 7.0% and 10.3%. Compared with patients with pneumonia, mean post-discharge out-of-pocket spending among COVID-19 patients was higher among the privately insured ($ 534 vs $ 445) and lower among Medicare Advantage patients ($ 680 vs $ 918).

CONCLUSIONSOut-of-pocket spending for immediate post-discharge care can be substantial for many patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Among Medicare Advantage patients, post-discharge out-of-pocket spending was higher after pneumonia hospitalizations, potentially because insurer cost-sharing waivers fully covered the costs of COVID-19-related readmissions during the study period.

The following elements were used to define eligibility criteria: (1) Population, individuals at high-risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (pre-exposure), individuals who had close contact with a positive or probable case of COVID-19 (post-exposure), non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hospitalized patients with COVID-19; (2) Intervention, HCQ; (3) Comparison, placebo; (4) Outcomes: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for hospitalization, length of hospital stay, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), death, and adverse events; and (5) Study type, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Risk of bias was judged according to the Cochrane guidelines for RCTs. Treatment effects were reported as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous variables and mean difference (MD) for continuous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used either a fixed or random-effects model to pool the results of individual studies depending on the presence of heterogeneity. The GRADE system was used to evaluate the strength of evidence between use of HCQ and the outcomes of interest.

RESULTSFourteen blinded, placebo-controlled RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Four trials used HCQ as a prophylactic medication pre-exposure to COVID-19, two as a prophylactic medication post-exposure to COVID-19, three as treatment for non-hospitalized patients, and five as treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We found no decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals receiving HCQ as pre-exposure (RR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.77) or post-exposure (RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.29) prophylaxis to prevent COVID-19. There is no decreased risk of hospitalization for outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.23) and no decreased risk of MV (RR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.34) and death (RR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.78) among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving HCQ. The certainty of the results on the lack of clinical benefit for HCQ was rated as moderate. Moreover, our results demonstrated an increased risk for any adverse events and gastrointestinal symptoms among those using HCQ.

CONCLUSIONAvailable evidence based on the results of blinded, placebo-controlled RCTs showed no clinical benefits of HCQ as pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients with COVID-19.",NA,medrxiv

A total of 121 participants (baseline seropositive 46 and seronegative 75) were included to study the immune response to ChAdOx1-nCOV (Covishield) vaccine in previously infected or uninfected people. IgG antibodies were estimated at three different time intervals, i.e. pre-vaccination, 25-35 days post 1st vaccination and 25-35 days post 2nd vaccination. The IgG antibody titre was significantly high among previous seropositive subjects with single dose of vaccine compared to seronegative group with both doses of vaccine respectively (4.59{+/-}1.04 vs 3.08{+/-}1.22, p-value: <0.0001).

In conclusion, a single dose of Covishield(R) vaccine might be sufficient to induce an effective immune responsein subjects with prior SARS-CoV2 infection. Stratifying vacinees based on their SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody titre before vaccination would help in meeting the increasing vaccine demand and could be effective to circumvent further wave of the pandemic in India.",NA,medrxiv

Moreover, spike-specific CD8 T-cell levels after heterologous vaccination were significantly higher than after both homologous regimens. Cytokine expression profiling showed a predominance of polyfunctional T-cells expressing IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 with subtle differences between regimens. Both recipients of the homologous vector-regimen and the heterologous vector/mRNA-combination were most affected by the priming vector-vaccination, whereas heterologous boosting was well tolerated and comparable to homologous mRNA-boosting.

Neutralising antibodies (Nabs) are increasingly being recognised as a correlate of protection and whilst there are many studies which follow the response of a cohort of people, each study alone is not enough to predict the long term response. Studies use different assays to measure Nabs making them hard to combine. We present a modelling method which can combine multiple datasets and can be updated as more detailed data becomes available.

The serological antibody response induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have already been well characterized. In order to understand the mucosal immune response profiles of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we examined both the mucosal and systemic responses of subjects vaccinated by two different vaccination platforms: mRNA (Comirnaty) and inactivated virus (CoronaVac). Serial nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) and peripheral blood samples were collected in ten subjects who had received CoronaVac and thirty-two subjects who had received Comirnaty. We quantified IgA and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein by ELISA in NELF and plasma samples. The neutralization effect of these two sample types were evaluated by surrogate ACE-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ELISA. Only Comirnaty induced nasal SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein-specific (S1-specific) IgA and IgG responses, which were evident as early as on 14{+/-}2 days after the first dose. The NELF samples of 72% of subjects became IgA+IgG+, while in 62.5% of subjects the samples were neutralizing by 7{+/-}2 days after the second dose. In 45% of the subjects their NELF remained neutralizing 50 days after the booster of Comirnaty. In plasma, 91% and 100% Comirnaty subjects possessed S1-specific IgA+IgG+ on 14{+/-}2 days after the first dose and 7{+/-}2 days after booster, respectively. The plasma collected on 7{+/-}2 days after booster was 100% neutralizing. The induction of S1-specific antibody by CoronaVac was IgG dominant, and 70% of the subjects possessed S1-specific IgG by 7{+/-}2 days after booster and were all neutralizing. This study reveals that Comirnaty is able to induce S1-specific IgA and IgG response with neutralizing activity in the nasal mucosa in addition to a consistent systemic response. The clinical implications and the biological mechanism of an additional nasal immune response induced by vaccines such as Comirnaty warrant further investigation.

The daily number of patients testing positive for COVID-19. We used Poisson regression analysis with sandwich estimator to evaluate the association between election and the spread of COVID-19 infections. For Miyakojima City, we assessed the relationship between election and COVID-19 infections by using the Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We also estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) in the city. There were 17 cities that met the inclusion criteria. In all models with three types of different lag effects (i.e., 4, 9, and 14 days), election was not a significant predictor of COVID-19 infections in the 17 cities. For Miyakojima City, the autoregressive integrated moving average (0, 0, 0) with a lag of 14 (=14) was the best model. The partial coefficient ({omega}) of the election was 11.91 (95% confidence interval: 3.10-20.72, P<0.001), indicating that the election was associated with an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases 14 days after the election campaign (mean: 12 cases/day). Rt hovered far above 1 during and after the election campaign in Miyakojima. Although elections were associated with an increased number of COVID-19 cases in Miyakojima, this association was not verified in the analysis including all 17 cities.

Refractory hypoxemia in these patients requires invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) otherwise, death is imminent. In places with a high disease burden, availability of critical care experts, beds, or resources is challenged and many patients could die without receiving them.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study using open databases from Mexico City about suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, health system saturation, and deaths between May 8th, 2020, and January 5th, 2021. After building a directed acyclic graph, we performed a binary logistic regression to identify the association between proposed causal variables and dying without receiving IMV (the outcome).

ResultsWe included 33 805 hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, of which 19 820 (58.6%) did not require IMV and survived, 5416 (16.1%) required and received IMV, and 8569 (25.3%) required IMV but died without receiving it. Saturation of IMV-capable beds did not increase the odds of the outcome (odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.22 of 90%vs50% occupancy), while general bed saturation (2, 1.86-2.14 of 90%vs50% occupancy) and IMV-capable to general bed ratio (1.64, 1.52-1.77 for a ratio of 2vs0.5) did. Private healthcare decreased the odds of the outcome (0.12, 0.08-0.17) and dyspnea increased them (1.33, 1.19-1.9).

ConclusionsIn Mexico City, increased general hospital bed saturation and IMV-capable to general bed ratio were associated with a higher risk of dying without receiving IMV. Private healthcare was the most protective factor.

Key messagesO_LIHospital saturation has been a central feature of public health messaging, but it is not known how outcomes relate to hospital saturation or capacity.
C_LIO_LIIn Mexico City, 90% of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation died but less than half received it.
C_LIO_LIHigher general bed saturation and an increased ratio of IMV-capable beds to general beds increased the probability of dying without being intubated while receiving private healthcare decreased this probability.
C_LIO_LIHaving available beds to intubate patients is possible thanks to the conversion of general beds, however, still yields suboptimal critical care.

By June of 2020, many people reported experiencing mild COVID-19 associated symptoms, yet did not get tested due to inaccessible testing and insufficient knowledge of the disease. There were media stories quoting grave diggers in Kano who reported high burial rates during this time.

MethodsIn order to draw more data on COVID-19 cases during this time period, we conducted a cross-sectional symptom survey in Kano, surveying 291 adults. Participants were asked to report demographic characteristics, past COVID-19 testing and symptoms, and community deaths. To assess associations between COVID-19 associated symptoms and socio-demographic characteristics, bivariate analyses using Chi-square tests were performed. A logistic regression assessing the association between any reported symptoms and the kind of work (indoor/outdoor) was done while adjusting for age, gender and education level.

ResultsHalf of the respondents reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19; the three most common symptoms were loss of appetite, cough, and fever. There was a statistically significant relationship between age group of the respondent and presence of COVID-19 associated symptoms. Gender or level of education did not have statistically significant association with COVID-19 associated symptoms among the respondents. People with outdoor occupations such as trading and hawking were more than twice as likely to report COVID-19 associated symptoms compared to those who were unemployed. Just under half of the respondents reported knowing someone who died in their community, with unexplained causes attributed to two-thirds of these cases.

ObjectivesThe primary objective is to determine if sending a single written message directly to individuals increases influenza vaccine uptake, and a secondary objective is to identify any identified content shown to increase influenza vaccine uptake.

MethodsPubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science were searched for English language RCTs testing a single correspondence for members of the community in OECD countries to obtain influenza vaccination. A meta-analysis with inverse-variance, random-effects modelling was used to estimate a mean, weighted risk ratio effect size measure of vaccine uptake. Studies were quality assessed and analysis was undertaken to account for potential publication bias.

ResultsTwenty-two randomized controlled trials were included covering 37 interventions. Of the 37 interventions, 32 (86%) report an increase in influenza vaccination rates. A formal meta-analysis shows that sending a single written message increases influenza vaccine uptake by 18% (RR = 1.18, 95%CI [1.13-1.22], Z = 8.56, p < .001) relative to the no contact comparator group. Analysis shows that the intervention is effective across correspondence type, age group, time, and location, and after allowing for risk of publication bias.

LimitationsThe review was restricted to English language publications, and the generalizability of results across the OECD may be questioned.

Conclusions and implicationsThe implication for public health authorities organizing vaccination programs for influenza, and arguably also for COVID-19, is that sending written vaccination correspondence to members of the community is likely to increase uptake.

For the geographic regions with a prevalence greater than or equal to 0.20 (Forest plot overall; prevalence = 0.20, p < 0.01, Q = 10476.22 and I2 = 100%), the most commonly detected viruses were: enteric coronavirus (ECoV), pigeon-dominant coronavirus, (PdCoV), Avian coronavirus M41, Avian coronavirus C46, Avian coronavirus A99, Avian coronavirus JMK, MERS-CoV, Bovine coronavirus, Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gamacoronavirus and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). The wide presence of different strains of coronavirus in different animal species on all continents demonstrates the great biodiversity and ubiquity of these viruses.

The most recent epidemiological crises caused by coronavirus demonstrates our unpreparedness to anticipate and mitigate emerging risks, as well as the need to implement new epidemiological surveillance programs for viruses.

Staff may feel that they, or other people, have acted wrongly and be distressed by this. This represents moral injury, which has been linked with significant mental ill health.

This survey asked essential workers in County Durham and Darlington about their experiences during the first wave of the pandemic and anything they felt would help. Wellbeing and moral injury were rated using sliders.

There were 566 responses. A majority of respondents reported feeling troubled by other peoples actions they felt were wrong (60% scored over 40, where 0 is ""not at all troubled"" and 100 ""very troubled"", median score=52.5). Respondents were generally less troubled by their own actions (median score=3). Wellbeing and moral injury scores varied by employment sector (e.g. NHS staff were more troubled by the actions of others than non-NHS staff).

Staff suggestions included regular supervisor check-ins, ensuring kindness from everyone, fair rules and enforcement and improving communication and processes. Respondents offered simple, practical actions that could be taken by leaders at team, organisation, societal and government policy levels to tackle moral injury and the underlying causes of moral injurious environments.

Using these findings to develop a strategy to address moral injury is important, not only for staff wellbeing, but staff retention and continued delivery of vital services in these challenging times.

DesignAn ecological study on disease burden.

MethodsWe used the publicly available Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data from 1990 to 2017. The age and sex-specific incidence, prevalence rate, Years Lived with Disability (YLDs), and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were examined among per 100,000 populations.

ResultsFemales had a higher prevalence of depressive 4094.4 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 3761.9-4470.3 per 100,000) and anxiety 4496.8 (95% UI: 4171.9-4837.9 per 100,000) disorders. The prevalence of major depressive disorders was comparatively higher in females (2766.7) than males (1822.9). Females also had higher YLDs for both depressive and anxiety disorders. In 2017, higher DALYs of anxiety disorder were found in the females of 45-49 years (630.1). Childhood sexual abuse was found to be the main risk factor for depressive disorder, contributing to 32.5 DALYs in both sexes. Bullying, victimization had contributed to 26.7 DALYs of anxiety.

While large MRI studies in the normative population have led to a better understanding of brain growth trajectories across the lifespan, such results remain elusive for preterm-born individuals since large, aggregated datasets of preterm-born individuals do not exist. To close this gap, we investigated GMV and WMV in preterm-born individuals as reported in the literature and contrasted it against individual volumetric data and trajectories from the general population.

Study designSystematic database search of PubMed and Web of Science in March 2021 and extraction of outcome measures by two independent reviewers. Individual data on full-term controls was extracted from freely available databases. Mean GMV, WMV, total intracranial volume (TIV), and mean age at scan were the main outcome measures.

ResultsOf 532 identified records, nine studies were included with 538 preterm-born subjects between 1.1 and 28.5 years of age. Reference data was generated from 880 full-term controls between 1 and 30 years of age. GMV was consistently reduced in preterm-born individuals from infancy to early adulthood with no evidence for catch-up growth. While GMV changes followed a similar trajectory as full-term controls, WMV was particularly low in adolescence after preterm birth.

ConclusionsResults demonstrate altered brain volumes after premature birth across the first half of lifespan with pronounced reductions of white matter volumes in adolescence. Future studies should address this issue in large aggregated datasets of preterm-born individuals.",NA,medrxiv

Body-weight-support systems (BWSSs) minimize this risk and allow patients to safely practice balance activities during therapy. Treadmill based balance perturbation systems with BWSSs are known to improve balance in patients with age or disease related impairments. However, these stationary systems are unable accommodate complex exercises requiring more freedom of movement.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the impact of a new balance perturbation module, which is directly integrated to a track-mounted BWSS, has on patient balance after acute stroke.

DesignUnblinded quasi-randomized controlled pilot study.

InterventionsBWSS and BWSS with perturbation (BWSS-P) training was incorporated into the participants regular treatment. While both groups conducted the same balance and gait activities during their treatment sessions, the BWSS-P sessions included lateral and anterior/posterior resistive or assistive balance perturbations.

Main outcome measuresBBS and Activities-Specific Balance-Confidence (ABC) assessments were the main outcome measure collected. Institutional BBS data from fiscal-year 2018, prior to installation of the track mounted BWSS, was used as a historical standard-of-care (SOC) baseline.

Hallmark is the surprisingly simple genome with inactivating mutations or deletions in the SMARCB1 gene as the oncogenic driver. Nevertheless, AT/RTs are infiltrated by immune cells and even clonally expanded T cells. However, it is unclear, which epitopes T-cells might recognize on AT/RT cells. Here, we report a comprehensive MS-based analysis of naturally presented HLA-class-I and class-II ligands on 23 AT/RTs. Comparative HLA ligandome analysis of the HLA-ligandome revealed 55 class-I and 139 class-II tumor-exclusive peptides. No peptide originated from the SMARCB1-region. In addition, 61 HLA-class I tumor-exclusive peptide sequences derived from non-canonically translated proteins. Combination of peptides from natural and cryptic class I and class II origin gave optimal representation of tumor cell compartments. Substantial overlap existed with the cryptic immunopeptidome of glioblastomas but no concordance was found with extracranial tumors. More than 80% of AT/RT-exclusive peptides were able to successfully prime CD8+ T-cells, whereas naturally occurring memory responses in AT/RT-patients could only be detected for class-II epitopes. Interestingly, >50% of AT/RT-exclusive class-II ligands were also recognized by T-cells from glioblastoma patients but not from healthy donors. These findings highlight that AT/RTs, potentially paradigmatic for other pediatric tumors with a low mutational load, present a variety of highly immunogenic HLA-class-I and class-II peptides from canonical as well as non-canonical protein sources. Inclusion of such cryptic peptides into therapeutic vaccines would enable an optimized mapping of the tumor cell surface, thereby reducing the likelihood of immune evasion.

ObjectiveTo analyze the ease of reading (i.e., readability) of the EUA-approved fact sheets for the vaccines currently available in the United States, the V-Safe adverse event survey script, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website on COVID-19 vaccines.

DesignWe analyzed the readability of Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen EUA fact sheets, as well as the V-Safe survey script and the vaccine-related information on the CDC website.

MeasurementsReadability factors include the following: average length of paragraphs, sentences, and words; font size and style; use of passive voice; the Gunning-Fog index; the Flesch Reading Ease index; and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level index.

ResultsOnly the V-Safe adverse event survey script met readability standards for adequate comprehension.

Design, setting, and participantsThis was a cross-sectional online survey study hosted by Survey Monkey and implemented for 10 days from May 14 2021. People who aged 18 years or above and had been residing in Macao for 12 months prior to the study were recruited through social media.

Main outcomes and measuresIntention, the constructs of protection motivation theory (perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, maladaptive response reward, self-efficacy, response-efficacy, and response cost), constructs of health belief model (cues to action), social attitude, social norm, past experience and information seeking behavior, in addition to demographic variables.

ResultsOf the 552 respondents, 79.5% aged between 25 and 54 years old, 59.4% were female, and 88% had a bachelor degree or above. Overall, 62.3% of the respondents indicated their intention while 19.2% were hesitant and 18.5% did not have any intention. While 67.0% believed COVID-19 infection was life-threatening, only 19.0% thought they were at risk. Control variables such as age, gender, education level, and having travel plans were significantly correlated with intention. Significant associations were found between intention and all the measures (p<0.05). The most important positive predictors of intention were ""being able to make arrangement to receive the vaccine"" ({beta} = 0.333, P <0.001), ""a sense of social responsibility"" ({beta} = 0.326, P < 0.001), and ""time off from work after vaccination"" ({beta} = 0.169, P <0.001), whereas ""concerns over vaccine safety"" ({beta} = - 0.124, P < 0.001) and ""relying on online resources for vaccine information"" ({beta} = -0.065, P <0.05) were negative predictors.

However, in patients who have already received antibiotics for the treatment of active infections prior to surgery, the risks and benefits of administering prophylactic antibiotics are unknown. We aimed to assess the necessity of perioperative prophylactic antibiotic administration in patients receiving antibiotic treatment for active infections.

MethodThis was a retrospective, chart-review cohort study. Between January 2018 to May 2018, adult patients who underwent inpatient surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, and were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics based on institutional protocol, while receiving antibiotic treatment within 48 hours prior to surgery, were included in the study. The primary endpoint was the rate of duplicative antibiotic therapy, which was defined as the administered prophylactic antibiotic (1) exhibiting similar or narrower bacterial coverage as the treatment antibiotic(s), and (2) given within the dose interval of the treatment antibiotic(s).

The importance of climate for health is recognised by healthcare professionals, who need to be equipped to deliver environmentally sustainable healthcare and promote planetary health. There is some evidence that climate change and health is not strongly embedded in accredited master-level public health training programs and medical programs globally, however, the immersion of climate-health in Australian and New Zealand programs is unclear.

ObjectivesTo explore the extent to which climate-health education is currently embedded into public health and medical curricula in Australia and New Zealand.

MethodsEducators identified by their coordination, convenorship, or delivery into programs of public health and medicine at universities in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate in a cross-sectional, exploratory mixed methods study. Participants completed an online quantitative survey and qualitative interviews regarding their experience in program and course delivery, and the prominence of climate-health content within program and course delivery. Quantitative surveys were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative interview content was analysed via a modified ground theory approach.

ResultsThe response rate of the quantitative survey was 43.7% (21/48). Ten survey respondents also completed qualitative interviews. Quantitative results showed that epidemiologists were the most common experts involved in design and delivery of this curriculum, with a reliance on guest lecturers to provide updated content.

We analysed twelve-month retention in the SLATE SDI trials.

MethodsSLATE I and SLATE II were individually randomized trials at public outpatient clinics in Johannesburg that enrolled patients not yet on ART and administered the SLATE I or II algorithm, which included a symptom self-report, medical history, brief physical examination, and readiness questionnaire, to assess eligibility for SDI. ART uptake and early retention have been reported. Using routine clinic records, we conducted a pooled analysis of retention in care and HIV viral suppression 14 months after study enrolment.

Results and discussionWe enrolled 1,193 study participants (standard arms, n=599, 50%; intervention arms, n=594, 50%) and analysed by originally assigned groups. By 14 months after study enrolment (equivalent to 12-month retention in care), 50% of intervention arm patients and 46% of standard arm patients remained in care at the initiating site (crude risk difference 4% (95% confidence interval -1% to 10%; crude relative risk 1.10 (0.97-1.23), with similar viral suppression between arms. Observed attrition from care at site by 14 months was high in both study arms, but we found no evidence that the offer of SDI led to greater overall attrition or lower rates of viral suppression one year after starting ART and may have led to small improvements. Same-day initiation may have shifted some attrition from before to after dispensing of the first dose of medication.

ConclusionsAn offer of same-day initiation of ART, following a carefully designed protocol to identify patients who are eligible and ready to start treatment, is not inherently associated with an overall increase in patient attrition from care.

PURPOSETo map differences in biomechanical and functional properties between tumor and healthy tissue, to study their spatial distribution, and to assess any relationship between biomechanical and functional properties.

STUDY TYPEProspective.

SUBJECTSNine patients with glioblastoma, 17 healthy subjects

FIELDSTRENGTH/SEQUENCE3T, MRE, DSC, DTI, ASL

ASSESSMENTStiffness and viscosity measurements G' and G'', cerebral blood flow (CBF), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in patients contrast-enhancing tumor, necrosis, edema, and gray and white matter, and in gray and white matter for healthy subjects.

STATISTICAL TESTSVoxel-wise regression analysis using a linear and a random forest model for CBF as a function of ADC, FA, G' and G''. Model performance was evaluated by root-mean-square error with a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation strategy. A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparisons of different regions and models. A significance level of P<0.05 was assumed for all tests.

RESULTSMedian G' and G'' in contrast-enhancing tumor were 15 % and 39 % lower than in normal-appearing white matter (cNAWM), respectively (P<0.01). FA was 53 % lower in tumor compared to cNAWM (P<0.01). ADC and CBF were 50 % and 2.9 times higher in tumor than in cNAWM, respectively (P<0.01). For both models, prediction of CBF was improved by adding MRE measurements to the model, compared to a baseline model with ADC and FA as predictors (P<0.05).

DATA CONCLUSIONTumors differed from healthy tissue with regard to G' and G'', CBF, ADC and FA, with heterogeneity both between patients and within tumors. Measurements approached values in normal-appearing tissue when moving outward from the tumor core, but abnormal tissue properties were still present in regions of normal-appearing tissue. The inclusion of MRE measurements in statistical models helped predict perfusion, with stiffer tissue associated with lower perfusion values.",NA,medrxiv

There may be a delay in or a poor outcome of endovascular treatment (EVT) among AIS patients with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) during off-hours. By using a prospective, nationwide registry, we compared the workflow intervals and radiological/clinical outcomes between patients with acute LVO treated with EVT presenting during off- and on-hours.

MethodsWe analyzed prospectively collected Endovascular Treatment Key Technique and Emergency Work Flow Improvement of Acute Ischemic Stroke (ANGEL-ACT) data. Patients presenting during off-hours were defined as those presenting to the emergency department from Monday to Friday between the hours of 17:30 and 08:00, on weekends (from 17:30 on Friday to 08:00 on Monday), and on national holidays. We used logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounders to determine independent associations between the time of presentation and outcomes.

ResultsAmong 1788 patients, 1079 (60.3%) presented during off-hours. The median onset-to-door time and onset-to-reperfusion time were significantly longer during off-hours than on-hours (165 vs 125 minutes, P=0.002 and 410 vs 392 minutes, P=0.027). However, there were no significant differences between patients presenting during off- and on-hours in any radiological/clinical outcomes (mRS score: 3 vs 3 points, P=0.204; mortality: 15.9% vs 14.3%, P=0.172; successful reperfusion: 88.5% vs 87.2%, P=0.579; sICH: 7.2% vs 8.4%, P=0.492).

ConclusionsOff-hours presentation in the nationwide real-world registry was associated with a delay in the visit and reperfusion time of EVT in patients with AIS. However, this delay did not lead to worse radiological/clinical outcomes.

In this work, we identified ways to calculate these real-world endpoints with structured EHR data, and validated these endpoints against the gold-standard measurements of these endpoints derived from linked EHR and TR data. In addition, we also examined and reported the data quality issues especially the inconsistency between the EHR and TR data.

We conducted a cross-sectional study administered through a phone-based survey in February 2021 in four counties of Kenya. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify individual perceived risks and influences, context-specific factors, and vaccine-specific issues associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Kenya was high: 60.1%. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy included: older age, lower education level, perceived difficulty in adhering to government regulations on COVID-19 prevention, less adherence to wearing of face masks, not having ever been tested for COVID-19, no reported socio-economic loss as a result of COVID public-health restriction measures, and concerns regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness. There is a need for the prioritization of interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccine confidence as part of the vaccine roll-out plan.

However, how dynamic immunologic changes in pregnancy influence immune responses to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is unknown.

ObjectivesWe performed a detailed characterization of Mtb-specific T cell responses of women at high risk for Mtb infection, leveraging a biorepository of longitudinally samples collected before, during, and after pregnancy in high HIV/TB burden settings.

MethodsWe used specimens collected from women who became pregnant while enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention. We measured Mtb-specific cytokines, CCR7 and CD45RA memory markers, and overall CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation from 49 women using COMPASS, a Bayesian statistical method for evaluating overall antigen-specific T cell responses measured by flow cytometry.

Measurements and Main Results22 LTBI+ women, defined by flow cytometry, demonstrated significantly diminished Mtb-specific CD4+ cytokine responses in the third trimester (COMPASS score (PFS) 0.07) compared before (PFS 0.15), during (PFS 0.13 and 0.16), and after pregnancy (PFS 0.14; p = 0.0084, Kruskal-Wallis test). Paradoxically, Mtb-specific CD8+ cytokine responses and nonspecifically activated CD38+HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells increased during late pregnancy. Nonspecific T cell activation, a previously validated biomarker for progression from LTBI to TB disease, was increased in LTBI+ women postpartum, compared with LTBI-women.

ConclusionsPregnancy-related functional T cell changes were most pronounced during late pregnancy. Mtb-specific T cell changes during pregnancy and postpartum, increases in immune activation may contribute to increased risk for TB progression in the postpartum period.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsFine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) from outpatients ([&ge;]18 years) with presumptive TBL (n=135) underwent: 1) routine Xpert (later Ultra once programmatically available), 2) a MGIT960 culture (if Xpert- or Ultra-negative, or rifampicin-resistant), and 3) study Ultra. Concentrated paired urine underwent Ultra. Primary analyses used a microbiological reference standard (MRS).

ResultsIn a head-to-head comparison (n=92) of FNAB study Ultra and Xpert, Ultra had increased sensitivity [91% (95% confidence interval 79, 98) vs. 72% (57, 84); p=0.016] and decreased specificity [76% (61, 87) vs. 93% (82, 99); p=0.020], and detected patients not on treatment.

We find that the WC ratio increases after key events, providing insight into the balance between disease spread and public health response. We also find that wastewater data preceded clinically reported cases in the first wave of the pandemic but did not serve as a leading indicator in the second wave, likely due to increased testing capacity.

By interpreting area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), CRP and NLR were better predictors of disease severity (AUC: 0.7 for both), the need for ICU admission (AUC: 0.763 and 0.727, respectively) and in-hospital mortality (AUC: 0.812 and 0.75, respectively). SII was significantly associated with the risk of severe disease development (odds ratio (OR): 3.143; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.101-8.976); CRP (OR: 2.902; CI95%: 1.342-6.273) and NLR (OR: 2.662; CI95%, 1.072-6.611) were significantly associated with ICU admission risk; and only CRP was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality risk (OR: 3.988; CI95%: 1.460-10.892).

ConclusionsValues of CRP, SII, and NLR at the time of hospital admission could be independent prognostic biomarkers to predict COVID-19 progression. The integration of CRP, SII, and NLR into prognostic nomograms may lead to improved prediction.",NA,medrxiv

Blood-pressure (BP) categorizations between systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120 and 140 remain debatable. In the current study we aim to evaluate if individuals with a baseline SBP between 130-140 mm Hg (hypertension as per AHA 2017 guidelines) have a significantly higher proportion of incident hypertension on follow-up, as compared to those with SBP between 120-130 mm Hg.

MethodsSecondary data analysis was performed in a community-based cohort, instituted, and followed since 2017. Participants were aged [&ge;]30 years, residents of urban slums in Bhopal. BP was measured at or near home by Community Health Workers (CHWs). Two-year follow up was completed in 2019. We excluded participants who were on BP reduction therapy, had fewer than two out-of-office BP measurements and who could not be followed. Eligible participants were re-classified based on baseline BP in four categories: Normal (Category-A), Elevated-BP (Category-B), Variable-BP (Category-C) and reclassified HTN based on AHA-2017 (Category-D). Proportion of individuals who developed incident hypertension on follow up was primary outcome.

ResultOut of 2649 records, 768 (28.9%), 647 (24.4%), 586 (22.1%), 648 (24.4%) belonged to Categories A, B, C and D respectively. Incident HTN with cut-off of 140/90 mm Hg was, 1.6%, 2.6%, 6.7%, 12% in categories A, B, C and D respectively. Incidence of incident hypertension in individuals with a baseline SBP between 130-140 mm Hg (Category D) was significantly higher as compared to those with SBP between 120-130 mm Hg (Category B).

ConclusionWe conclude that biological basis for AHA-2017 definition of hypertension is relatively robust also for low income and resource-limited settings. Evidence from our longitudinal study will be useful for policy makers for harmonizing national guidelines with AHA-2017.",NA,medrxiv

We find that people diagnosed outside of quarantine are 89% more infectious than those diagnosed while in quarantine, and infectiousness decreases as a function of the time spent in quarantine. Furthermore, we find that people of working age, 16-66 years old, are 47% more infectious than those outside that age range. Lastly, the transmission tree enables us to model the effect that given population prevalence of vaccination would have had on the third wave had they been administered before that time using several different strategies.

There is no gold standard for clinical remission and Eo-associated metrics are poorly correlated with symptoms. Deep learning can be used to explore the relationships of tissue features with clinical response.

ObjectivesTo determine if deep learning can elucidate tissue patterns in EoE that predict treatments or symptoms at remission.

MethodsWe created two deep learning models using esophageal biopsies from histologically normal and EoE patients: one to identify Eos in esophageal biopsies and a second to broadly classify esophageal tissue as EoE vs. normal. We used these models to analyze biopsies at diagnosis and first remission timepoint, as defined by <15 Eos/HPF, in a subset of 19 treatment-naive patients. Differences in deep learning metrics between patient groups were assessed using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests.

ResultsAll initial patients were symptomatic at diagnosis and a majority were still suffering from dysphagia at remission. The Eo identification model had a low mean (SD) error of -0.3 (11.5) Eos/HPF. Higher peak and average Eo counts at diagnosis were associated with higher likelihood of being on a food-elimination diet at remission than steroids or proton-pump inhibitor (p<0.05). The EoE classification model had an F1-score of 0.97 for distinguishing normal tissue from EoE. There was a significant decrease from diagnosis in the percentage of EoE-classified tissue among asymptomatic remission patients (p<0.05).

ConclusionsDeep learning may have utility in diagnosing EoE and predicting future treatment response at diagnosis and resolution of symptoms at follow-up.

Clinical Implications or Key Messages (for mechanistic article)We developed two deep learning approaches for tissue analysis in eosinophilic esophagitis, which may improve histologic assessment of patients at diagnosis and predict treatment response and symptoms at remission.

In India, the physical activity levels of adult population have been reported to be declining in the recent years. However, large studies focusing on university students pertaining to their physical activity are not there in Indian context.  Do the curricula in higher education promote physical activity? is another question that has not been addressed well.

ObjectivesOur work aims at describing the physical activity levels of the students in a large public-funded central university located in northern India. The study also aims at capturing the student perceptions about the emphasis their curricular activities receive in connection with leading a physically active lifestyle.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional descriptive study and uses International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-Long form) to record physical activity among 4586 students. Stratified sampling method was used to enroll the students from each stream (faculty). About 15% of all enrolled students from each faculty were included in the study. The study was conducted in between 2016 and 2019. To capture the student perceptions, we have used a 5-item newly developed scale.

Results2828 (61.7%) male and 1758 (38.3%) female students participated in the study. The mean age of our sample was 22.34 {+/-} 3.12 years. Our results indicate that about 14.5% of all students in the study fall under  Inactive category. Further, the perception about the curricular content pertaining to physical activity varied widely between the students of different streams.

DiscussionOur sample reported a better physical activity pattern in comparison to the reported overall physical activity levels of adult population of India. Our results also suggest that health-related topics are inadequately represented in many of the streams of higher education in the university.",NA,medrxiv

Body mass index (BMI) and other clinical or consumer-facing tools for quantifying body fat (BF) are often inaccurate, cost-prohibitive, or cumbersome to use. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of a novel automated computer vision method, visual body composition (VBC), that uses two-dimensional photographs captured via a conventional smartphone camera to estimate percentage total body fat (%BF).

Methods134 healthy adults ranging in age (21-76 years), sex (61.2% women), race (60.4% Caucasian; 23.9% Black), and body mass index (BMI, 18.5-51.6 kg/m2) were evaluated at two clinical sites. Each participant had %BF measured with VBC, three consumer and two professional bioimpedance analysis (BIA) systems, as well as air displacement plethysmography (ADP). %BF measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was set as the reference against which all other estimates were compared.

ResultsRelative to DXA, VBC had the lowest mean absolute error and standard deviation (2.34%{+/-}1.83%) compared to all other evaluated methods (p<0.05 for all comparisons). %BF measured by VBC also had very good concordance with DXA (Lins concordance correlation coefficient, CCC: overall 0.94; women 0.92; men 0.90); whereas BMI had very poor concordance (CCC: overall 0.45; women 0.40; men 0.74). Bland-Altman analysis of VBC revealed the tightest limits of agreement (LOA) and absence of significant bias relative to DXA (bias 0.85%, R2=0.01; p=0.41; LOA -4.7% to +6.4%), whereas all other evaluated methods had significant (p<0.01) bias and wider limits of agreement.

ConclusionIn this first validation study of a novel, accessible, and easy-to-use system, VBC body fat estimates were accurate and without significant bias compared to DXA as the reference; VBC performance exceeded those of all other BIA and ADP methods evaluated. The wide availability of smartphones suggests that the VBC method for evaluating %BF can play a major role in quantifying adiposity levels in a wide range of settings.

We hypothesized individuals who walked farther distances (FARhigh) in the hospital would have a higher resting middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and a greater cerebrovascular response (CVR) to moderate-intensity exercise at 3-months post-stroke, compared to individuals who walked shorter distances (FARlow).

MethodsAt 3-month post-stroke, we recorded 90-seconds of baseline (BL) MCAv followed by 6-minutes of moderate-intensity exercise. We calculated CVR as the change in MCAv from BL to steady-state exercise. We collected farthest distance walked from the electronic medical record. We divided individuals based on average farthest walking distance, (FARhigh or FARlow).

ResultsParticipants (n = 20) were 63 {+/-} 15 years. BL MCAv was not different between groups (p = 0.07). In comparison to FARlow, we report a higher CVR in FARhighs ipsilesional ([Formula] vs [Formula], p = 0.02) and contralesional hemisphere ([Formula] vs [Formula], p = 0.04).

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of REGEN-COV in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus a single dose of REGEN-COV 8g (casirivimab 4g and imdevimab 4g) by intravenous infusion (REGEN-COV group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed first among patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at randomisation (seronegative) and then in the overall population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021, 9785 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, including 3153 (32%) seronegative patients, 5272 (54%) seropositive patients and 1360 (14%) patients with unknown baseline antibody status. In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 451 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0{middle dot}80; 95% CI 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}91; p=0{middle dot}0010). In an analysis involving all randomised patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 944 (20%) of 4839 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 1026 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0{middle dot}94; 95% CI 0{middle dot}86-1{middle dot}03; p=0{middle dot}17). The proportional effect of REGEN-COV on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity = 0{middle dot}001).

Understanding this is crucial to predict pathogen spread and the effectiveness of control efforts. Most analyses of contact patterns to date have focussed on high-income settings.

MethodsHere, we conduct a systematic review and individual-participant meta-analysis of surveys carried out in low- and middle-income countries and compare patterns of contact in these settings to surveys previously carried out in high-income countries. Using individual-level data from 28,503 participants and 413,069 contacts across 27 surveys we explored how contact characteristics (number, location, duration and whether physical) vary across income settings.

ResultsContact rates declined with age in high- and upper-middle-income settings, but not in low-income settings, where adults aged 65+ made similar numbers of contacts as younger individuals and mixed with all age-groups. Across all settings, increasing household size was a key determinant of contact frequency and characteristics, but low-income settings were characterised by the largest, most intergenerational households. A higher proportion of contacts were made at home in low-income settings, and work/school contacts were more frequent in high-income strata. We also observed contrasting effects of gender across income-strata on the frequency, duration and type of contacts individuals made.

ConclusionsThese differences in contact patterns between settings have material consequences for both spread of respiratory pathogens, as well as the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Diagnosis and monitoring of the disease typically rely on the laborious examination of physical symptoms by medical experts, which is necessarily limited and may not detect the prodromal stages of the disease.

New MethodWe propose a lightweight ([~]20K parameters) deep learning model, to discriminate between resting-state EEG recorded from people with PD and healthy controls. The proposed CRNN model consists of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with gated recurrent units (GRUs). The 1D CNN layers are designed to extract spatiotemporal features across EEG channels, which are subsequently supplied to the GRUs to discover temporal features pertinent to the classification.

ResultsThe CRNN model achieved 99.2% accuracy, 98.9% precision, and 99.4% recall in classifying PD from healthy controls (HC). Interrogating the model, we further demonstrate that the model is sensitive to dopaminergic medication effects and predominantly uses phase information of the EEG signals.

Comparison with Existing MethodsThe CRNN model achieves superior performance compared to baseline machine learning methods and other recently proposed deep learning models.

ConclusionThe approach proposed in this study adequately extracts the spatial and temporal features in multi-channel EEG signals that enable the accurate differentiation between PD and HC. It has excellent potential for use as an oscillatory biomarker for assisting in the diagnosis and monitoring of people with PD. Future studies to further improve and validate the models performance in clinical practice are warranted.",NA,medrxiv

AimsTo delineate the associations between affective and CFS-like symptoms in COVID-19 and chest CT-scan anomalies (CCTAs), oxygen saturation (SpO2), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin, calcium, magnesium, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and soluble advanced glycation products (sRAGEs).

MethodThe above biomarkers were assessed in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 heathy controls who had measurements of the Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue (FF) Rating Scales.

ResultsPartial Least Squares-SEM analysis showed that reliable latent vectors could be extracted from a) key depressive and anxiety and physiosomatic symptoms (the physio-affective or PA-core), b) IL-6, IL-10, CRP, albumin, calcium, and sRAGEs (the immune response core); and c) different CCTAs (including ground glass opacities, consolidation, and crazy paving) and lowered SpO2% (lung lesions).

In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus.

There is a lack of serological prevalence data in this age group. We have some interim data from our research for WHO unity protocol, which might help policymakers and the research community to answer such questions based on evidence. Hence, we conducted a study to compare the COVID -19 sero-positivity rate between children and adults

Methods/MaterialsThis is part of an ongoing large multi-centric population-based sero-epidemiological study. The study is being conducted in five selected states with a proposed total sample size of 10,000. We have data of 4,500 participants at the time of midterm analysis from four states of India. Total serum antibody against SARS-CoV-2 virus was assessed qualitatively by using a standard ELISA kit. Here we are reporting the interim data of serological prevalence among children aged between 2 to 17 years along with a comparison with [&ge;]18-year old participants.

ResultsThe data collection period was from 15th March 2021 to 10th June 2021. Total available data was of 4,509 participants out of which <18 years were 700 and [&ge;]18 years was 3,809. The site-wise number of available data among the 2-17 year age group were 92, 189, 165, 146 and 108 for the site of Delhi urban resettlement colony, Delhi rural (Villages in Faridabad district under Delhi NCR), Bhubaneswar rural, Gorakhpur rural and Agartala rural area respectively. The seroprevalence was 55.7% in the <18 years age group and 63.5% in the [&ge;] 18 year age group. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence between adult and children.

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity rate among children was high and were comparable to the adult population. Hence, it is unlikely that any future third wave by prevailing COVID-19 variant would disproportionately affect children two years or older.",NA,medrxiv

DesignClaims-based retrospective cohort study of incidence.

SettingUS commercial health insurance administrative claims database.

ParticipantsAdults 25-65 years of age between 2015 and 2019 with a minimum of 12 consecutive thrombosis-free months of continuous enrollment beginning 2014 were selected.

Main OutcomesAge (10 year intervals) and sex stratum specific incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were determined for: venous thromboembolism (VTE), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), and any major thrombosis. Incidence also was estimated for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

ResultsAmong approximately 15 million enrollees per year (half female/male), incidence of any thrombotic event (DVT, PE, CVT, or other thrombosis) was 247.89 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 245.96, 249.84). Incidence of VTE was 213.79 with ICD codes alone (95% CI: 211.99, 215.59) and 127.18 (95% CI: 125.80, 128.58) when also requiring a filled anticoagulation prescription. Incidence rates were 6.37 for CVT (95% CI: 6.07, 6.69), 26.06 for ITP (95% CI: 25.44, 26.78), 0.94 for HUS (95% CI: 0.82, 1.06), and 4.82 for HIT (95% CI: 4.56, 5.10). The co-occurrence of CVT with either ITP or HIT (diagnoses within 14 days of one another) was 0.090 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.13). Incidence tended to increase with age and was higher for women under 55. Incidence for CVT, HUS, and CVT with ITP or HIT was higher for women in all age groups.

ConclusionsThese results are the first US estimates for incidence of thrombotic and rare events in a large, commercially-insured US population. Findings provide a critically important reference for determining excess morbidity associated with COVID-19 and more generally for vaccine pharmacovigilance.

However, the diagnosis of fever must be made only in the presence of associated symptoms that can distinguish it from the mere asymptomatic physiologic rise of temperature. Association of the temperature values with the symptoms to define the cut-off for fever is need of the hour.

MethodsA longitudinal study on the healthy population of Northen-India were followed-up over 1-year. Participants were advised for self-monitoring of oral temperature with a standard digital thermometer in either left or right sublingual pocket and record it in the thermometry diary. The study was considered complete if the participant had all the three phases of the study (i.e. non-febrile, febrile, and post-febrile phases) or completed the duration of the study.

ResultsPer protocol analysis done for febrile participants (n=144, temperature recordings= 23851). The mean febrile phase temperature was 100.25 {+/-} 1.440F. A temperature of 99.10F had maximum diagnostic accuracy for feeling feverish (98.2%), along with one (98.3%) or two (99%) associated symptoms. Summer and spring months showed higher temperatures (100.38 {+/-} 1.44 v/s 99.80 {+/-} 1.49, P<0.001), whereas no significant temperature difference could be noted amongst the gender.

ConclusionsA revised cut-off for the temperature to decide fever is hereby proposed: 99.10F along with one or two associated symptoms. This is going to redefine fever in the modern era completely.",NA,medrxiv

Improving locomotor function is a common goal of treatment. The current gold standard for assessing locomotor function in CP is the gross motor function measure (GMFM-66). The GMFM-66 requires an in-person assessment by a trained clinician. It would be useful to have a measure of function that is like the GMFM-66 but can be assessed through patient report.

MethodsWe queried the clinical databases of two motion analysis centers (Gillette Childrens Specialty Healthcare and Shriners Hospital - Salt Lake City) for individuals with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) who were 18 years old or younger and had undergone instrumented clinical gait analysis that included the functional assessment questionnaire (FAQ). We computed the transformed FAQ (FAQt) as the weighted sum of the skills an individual was able to perform, where the weighting was the difficulty of the skills. We assessed concurrent and external validity of the FAQt by comparing it to the GMFM-66.

ResultsThe FAQt exhibited strong concurrent and external validity. Linear regression showed that the GMFM-66 explained 54% of the variance in FAQt, and the linear fit was independent of center. The FAQt evolved with age in a manner similar to the GMFM-66, with higher functioning individuals, as measured by gross motor function classification system level, achieving higher levels of function at a higher rate and an earlier age compared to their lower functioning peers. The findings with respect to GMFM-66 did not depend on the center at which the data was acquired.

ConclusionsThe FAQt demonstrates strong concurrent and external validity, making it a useful measure of locomotor function.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe obtained brain volume measurements using 3D magnetic resonance imaging for 351 adults with NF1 and, as a comparison group, 43 adults with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) or Schwannomatosis. We assessed a subset of 19 adults with NF1 for clinical severity of NF1 features and neurological problems and conducted psychometric testing for attention deficiencies and intelligence quotient. We compared brain volumes between NF1 patients and controls and correlated volumetric measurements to clinical and psychometric features in the NF1 patients.

ResultsTotal brain volume and total and regional white matter volumes were all significantly increased in adults with NF1. Grey matter volume decreased faster with age in adults with NF1 than in controls. Greater total brain volume and white matter volume were correlated with lower attention deficits and higher intelligence quotients in adults with NF1.

DesignLegal mapping and implementation framework-guided analysis

SettingU.S. states with state-level fertility preservation health insurance benefit mandates

Patient(s)Individuals at risk of iatrogenic infertility

Intervention(s)State laws mandating health insurance benefit coverage for fertility preservation services.

Main Outcome Measure(s)Design features of FP mandated benefit legislation; implementation process

Result(s)Between June, 2017 and March, 2021, 11 states passed FP benefit mandate laws. On average, states took 223 days to implement their mandates from the start of the laws enactment dates to their corresponding effective dates, and a majority issued regulatory guidance after the law was in effect. Significant variation was observed in which FP services were specified for inclusion or exclusion in the laws and/or regulator guidance. Federal policies impacted state level implementation, with the ACA and HIPAA guiding design of fertility preservation benefits. In addition, a majority of states referenced medical society clinical practice guidelines in the design of FP mandated benefits.

ConclusionsOur policy scan documented significant variation in the design and implementation of health insurance benefit mandates for FP services. Future considerations for policy development include specificity and flexibility of benefit design, reference to external clinical practice guidelines to drive benefit coverage, inclusion of Medicaid populations in required coverage, and consideration of interaction with relevant state and federal policies. In addition, key considerations for implementation include the sufficient length of time for the implementation period, regulator guidance issued prior to the law going into effect, and explicit allocation of resources for the implementation process.",NA,medrxiv

However, researchers have also extensively studied the relationship of an individuals relative socioeconomic position with their wellbeing, frequently explained by the relative deprivation (RD) hypothesis. Despite the high socioeconomic inequality, research on RD in the Indian context is scarce. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship of RD in income with the risk of tobacco chewing and bidi smoking in a sample of Indian adults. We drew data from the second round of the nationally representative India Human Development Survey for our analysis. Using data on annual household equivalized income from 26,529 adults, we created the Yitzhaki index to operationalize RD in income. We then fitted survey adjusted logistic regression models accounting for age, gender, absolute household equivalized income, education, place of residence, caste, and religion. Odds ratios from fully adjusted models for the third tertile (greatest relative deprivation) versus the first tertile (lowest relative deprivation) ranged between 1.32 (95% CI=1.15, 1.50) and 1.63 (95% CI=1.40, 1.89) for tobacco chewing and varied between 0.99 (95% CI=0.86, 1.14) and 1.32 (95% CI=1.15, 1.51) for bidi smoking, depending on the reference group used to compute the RD measure. Our findings suggested that with higher RD, the risk of consumption of smokeless tobacco and bidi smoking was higher. These results point to the health hazard of relative deprivation in a society that has enjoyed rapid economic growth coupled with rising income inequality in the last few decades. Our findings call for a comprehensive assessment of the socioeconomic inequality in income and health observed in India and the implementation of efficient programs to narrow the gap.

A prominent characteristic of the disease is its high heterogeneity in manifestation as well as the progression rate. For sporadic Parkinsons Disease, which comprises 90% of all diagnoses, the relationship between the patient genome and disease onset or progression subtype remains largely elusive. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly adopted to study the genomics of diseases due to their ability to capture patterns within the vast feature space of the human genome that might be contributing to the phenotype of interest. In our study, we develop two machine learning models that predict the onset as well as the progression subtype of Parkinsons Disease based on subjects germline mutations. Our best models achieved an ROC of 0.77 and 0.61 for disease onset and subtype prediction, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our models present state-of-the-art prediction performances of PD onset and subtype solely based on the subjects germline variants. The genes with high importance in our best-performing models were enriched for several canonical pathways related to signaling, immune system, and protein modifications, all of which have been previously associated with PD symptoms or pathogenesis. These high-importance gene sets provide us with promising candidate genes for future biomedical and clinical research.",NA,medrxiv

Lateral flow tests for antigen and antibody detection are an obvious candidate for use in community-wide testing, because they are quick and cheap relative to lab-processed tests. However, their low accuracy has limited their adoption. We develop a new methodology to increase the diagnostic accuracy of a combination of cheap, quick and inaccurate index tests with correlated or discordant outcomes, and illustrate its performance on commercially available lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) for Sars-CoV-2 antibody detection.

Methods and FindingsWe analyze laboratory test outcomes of 300 serum samples from health care workers detected with PCR-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection at least 21 days prior to sample collection, and 500 pre-pandemic serum samples, from a national seroprevalence survey, tested using eight LFIAs (Abbott, Biosure/Mologic, Orientgene-Menarini, Fortress, Biopanda I, Biopanda II, SureScreen and Wondfo) and Hybrid DABA as reference test. For each of 14 two-test combinations (e.g., Abbott, Fortress) and 16 three-test combinations (e.g., Abbott, Fortress, Biosure/Mologic) used on at least 100 positive and 100 negative samples, we classify an outcome sequence - e.g., (+,-) for (Abbott, Fortress) - as positive if its combination positive predictive value (CPPV) exceeds a given threshold, set between 0 and 1. Our main outcome measures are the sensitivity and specificity of different classification rules for classifying the outcomes of a combination test. We define testing possibility frontiers which represent sensitivity and false positive rates for different thresholds. The envelope of frontiers further enables test selection.

The eight index tests individually meet neither the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencys 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity criterion, nor the US Center for Disease Controls 99.5% specificity criterion. Among these eight tests, the highest single-test LFIA specificity is 99.4% (with a sensitivity of 65.2%) and the highest single-test LFIA sensitivity is 93.4% (with a specificity of 97.4%). Using our methodology, a two-test combination meets the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencys criterion, achieving sensitivity of 98.4% and specificity of 98.0%. While two-test combinations meeting the US Center for Disease Controls 99.5% specificity criterion have sensitivity below 83.6%, a three-test combination delivers a specificity of 99.6% and a sensitivity of 95.8%.

ConclusionsCurrent CDC guidelines suggest combining tests, noting that ""performance of orthogonal testing algorithms has not been systematically evaluated"" and highlighting discordant outcomes. Our methodology combines available LFIAs to meet desired accuracy criteria, by identifying testing possibility frontiers which encompass benchmarks, enabling cost savings. Our methodology applies equally to antigen testing and can greatly expand testing capacity through combining less accurate tests, especially for use cases needing quick, accurate tests, e.g., entry to public spaces such as airports, nursing homes or hospitals.",NA,medrxiv

SettingCOVID-19 dedicated non-intensive care wards at 1 government hospital, 1 medical college teaching hospital and 1 medical university teaching hospital

Participants140 consenting, eligible, hospitalized adult patients suffering from mild and moderate symptomatic COVID-19 and confirmed by a diagnostic (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR assay on nasal and throat swab were randomized to SOC or SOC plus AYUSH 64. To be withdrawn if disease becomes severe.

InterventionsTwo tablets of AYUSH 64, 500 mg each, twice daily after meals, and continued till study completion. SOC (symptomatic and supportive) as per national guidelines of India for mild and moderate disease.

Main outcome measuresTime period to clinical recovery (CR) from randomization baseline and proportion with CR within 28 days time frame; CR defined in the protocol

Results140 patients randomized (70 in each arm); 138 patients with CR qualified for analysis. Both groups were matched at baseline. The mean time to CR from randomization was significantly superior in AYUSH 64 group (95% CI -3.03 to 0.59 days); a higher proportion (69.7%) in the first week (p=0.046, Chi-square). No significant differences observed for COVID-19 related blood assays (such as D-Dimer). AYUSH 64 arm showed significant (p<0.05) superior persistent improvement in general health, quality of life, fatigue, anxiety, stress, sleep and other psychosocial metrics. 1 patient on SOC required critical care. 48 adverse events (AE) reported in each group. Barring three SAE (in SOC), AE were mild and none were drug related. 22 participants (8 on AYUSH) were withdrawn. No deaths were reported.

ConclusionsAYUSH 64 hastened recovery, reduced hospitalization and improved overall health in mild and moderate COVID-19 when co-administered with SOC under medical supervision. It was safe and well tolerated. Further studies are warranted.

We describe eight rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human SARM1 variant alleles, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP), or other motor nerve disorders, that alter the SARM1 auto-inhibitory ARM domain and constitutively hyperactivate SARM1 NADase activity. The constitutive NADase activities of six of the variants are at least as high as that of SARM1 lacking the entire ARM domain and greatly exceed the basal activity of wild-type SARM1, even in the presence of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), its physiological activator. This rise in constitutive activity alone is enough to promote neuronal degeneration in response to otherwise non-harmful mild stress. Importantly, we provide evidence that these gain-of-function alleles are enriched in ALS and HSP patients compared to matched individuals without these conditions within ALS and other motor nerve disorder databases. Together, these data suggest these are risk alleles for ALS and other motor nerve disorders. The broad phenotypic heterogeneity and variable age-of-onset in patients with these alleles raises intriguing questions about the pathogenic mechanism of hyperactive SARM1 variants.",NA,medrxiv

We report the results of a Phase 2a trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04405570).

MethodsEligible participants included outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom onset within 7 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to 200 mg molnupiravir or placebo, or 3:1 to molnupiravir (400 or 800 mg) or placebo, twice-daily for 5 days. Antiviral activity was assessed as time to undetectable levels of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and time to elimination of infectious virus isolation from nasopharyngeal swabs.

ResultsAmong 202 treated participants, virus isolation was significantly lower in participants receiving 800 mg molnupiravir (1.9%) versus placebo (16.7%) at Day 3 (p = 0.02). At Day 5, virus was not isolated from any participants receiving 400 or 800 mg molnupiravir, versus 11.1% of those receiving placebo (p = 0.03). Time to viral RNA clearance was decreased and a greater proportion overall achieved clearance in participants administered 800 mg molnupiravir versus placebo (p = 0.01).

Niclosamide (NCS) is an anti-parasitic drug of known antiviral potential. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the antiviral effect and safety of NCS on SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 patients.

MethodsRandomized controlled open label clinical trial encompassed 75 COVID-19 patients treated with standard of care plus NCS were included as experimental group and 75 COVID-19 patients treated with only standard of care therapy as control group. Each group was composed of 25 mild, 25 moderate and 25 severe patients. Survival rate, time to recovery, and side effects were the main endpoints for the assessment of the therapeutic effect and safety of NCS.

ResultsNCS did not enhance survival rate as three of severe COVID-19 patients in NCS and in control groups died (P>0.05). However, NCS, compared to control group, reduced the time to recovery in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients about 5 and 3 days, respectively but not in mild patients (P[&le;]0.05). Most interestingly, NCS lowered time to recovery up to five days in patients with co-morbidities (P[&le;]0.05) whereas only one day lowered in patients without co-morbidities (P>0.05).

MethodsIndividuals [&ge;]12 years were enrolled within 96 hours of a household contact being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and randomized 1:1 to receive 1200 mg REGEN-COV or placebo via subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants without evidence of infection (SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR- negative) or prior immunity (seronegative) who subsequently developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 28-day efficacy assessment period.

ResultsSubcutaneous REGEN-COV significantly prevented symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with placebo (81.4% risk reduction; 11/753 [1.5%] vs. 59/752 [7.8%], respectively; P<0.0001), with 92.6% risk reduction after the first week (2/753 [0.3%] vs. 27/752 [3.6%], respectively). REGEN-COV also prevented overall infections, either symptomatic or asymptomatic (66.4% risk reduction).

Moreover, because they are intended to test cohort-level effects, RCTs rarely provide information to support precision medicine, which strives to choose the best treatment for an individual patient. If causal information could be efficiently extracted from widely available real-world data, the rapidity of treatment validation could be increased, and its costs reduced. Moreover, inferences could be made across larger, more diverse patient populations. We created a ""virtual trial"" by fitting a multilevel Bayesian survival model to treatment and outcome records self-reported by 451 brain cancer patients. The model recovers group-level treatment effects comparable to RCTs representing over 3200 patients. The model additionally discovers the feature-treatment interactions needed to make individual-level predictions for precision medicine.

We also examined the patterns of social networking service use, patient-generated health data on the digital platforms, and health information sharing attitudes and activities.

MethodsWe drew data from the National Cancer Institutes 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). Participants were divided into two groups by mental health status. Then, we described and compared the characteristics of social determinants of health, health status, sleeping and drinking behaviors, and patterns of social networking service use and health information data sharing between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the predictors of mental health. All analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates.

ResultsParticipants with mental health issues are significantly more likely to be younger, White, female, have a lower income, have a history of chronic diseases, less capable of taking care of their own health; regarding behavioral health, they sleep less than six hours on average, have worse sleep quality, consume more alcohol; meanwhile, they are more likely to visit and share health information on social networking sites, write online diary blogs, participate online forum or support groups, watch health-related videos.

This interval is widely used in daily clinical practice and is essential for assisting clinical decision making in diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that each individual indeed has a range for a given variable depending on personal biological traits. This Individual Reference Intervals (IRI) can be calculated and be utilized in clinical practice, in combination with the PRI for improved decision making where multiple data points are present per variable. As calculating IRI requires several data points from the same individual to determine a personal range, here we introduce novel methodologies to obtain the correct estimates of IRI. We use Linear Quantile Mixed Models (LQMM) and Penalized Joint Quantile Models (PJQM) to estimate the IRIs upper and lower bounds. The estimates are obtained by considering both the within and between subjects variations. We perform a simulation study designed to benchmark both methods performance under different assumptions, resulted in PJQM giving a better empirical coverage than LQMM. Finally, both methods were evaluated on real-life data consisting of eleven clinical and metabolomics parameters from the VITO IAM Frontier study.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighted the risk of rushing the publication of unvalidated findings, leading to damaging scientific miscommunication in the most extreme scenarios. Several high-profile preprints, later found to be deeply flawed, have indeed exacerbated widespread skepticism about the risks of the COVID-19 disease - at great cost to public health. Here, preprint article quality during the pandemic is examined by distinguishing papers related to COVID-19 from other research studies. Importantly, our analysis also investigated possible factors contributing to manuscript quality by assessing the relationship between preprint quality and gender balance in authorship within each research discipline. Using a comprehensive data set of preprint articles from medRxiv and bioRxiv from January to May 2020, we construct both a new index of manuscript quality including length, readability, and spelling correctness and a measure of gender mix among a manuscripts authors. We find that papers related to COVID-19 are less well-written than unrelated papers, but that this gap is significantly mitigated by teams with better gender balance, even when controlling for variation by research discipline. Beyond contributing to a systematic evaluation of scientific publishing and dissemination, our results have broader implications for gender and representation as the pandemic has led female researchers to bear more responsibility for childcare under lockdown, inducing additional stress and causing disproportionate harm to women in science.",NA,medrxiv

Although case fatality risk among pregnant women can reach as high as 25%, a lack of population-level disease burden data has been cited as a primary factor in key global policy recommendations against the routine use of licensed hepatitis E vaccines, one of the only effective tools available for preventing disease and death.

MethodsWe tested serum from a nationally-representative serosurvey in Bangladesh for anti-HEV IgG. We estimated the proportion of the population with evidence of historical HEV infection and used Bayesian geostatistical models to generate high-resolution national maps of seropositivity. We examined variability in seropositivity by individual-level, household-level, and community-level risk factors using spatial logistic regression.

ResultsWe tested serum samples from 2924 individuals from 70 communities representing all divisions of Bangladesh and estimated a national seroprevalence of hepatitis E of 20% (95% CI 17-24%). Seropositivity increased with age and male sex (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.8). Community-level seroprevalence ranged from 0-78% with the seroprevalence in urban areas being higher, including Dhaka, the capital, with 3-fold (95%CrI 2.3-3.7) higher seroprevalence than the rest of the country.

ConclusionHepatitis E infections are common throughout Bangladesh, though 90% of women reach reproductive age without any evidence of previous exposure to the virus, thus likely susceptible to infection and disease. Strengthening clinical surveillance for hepatitis E, especially in urban areas may help generate additional evidence needed to appropriately target interventions like vaccines to the populations most likely to benefit.",NA,medrxiv

We undertook an exploratory study to evaluate the promising low-cost methods for screening, including genetic risk scoring (GRS), advanced ECG (A-ECG), echocardiography and metabolomics.

Methods78 patients underwent advanced 5-min ECG and echocardiography, including global longitudinal strain (GLS), and echocardiographic calcium scoring (eCS). A GRS of 27 SNPs (GRS27) related to coronary disease and 3 SNPs for atrial fibrillation was used, as well as hs-troponin (Abbott, Singulex, Roche), NTproBNP (Roche) testing and targeted plasma metabolomics using GC-MS. Results were correlated with the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) (CT coronary angiography (CTCA)), measures of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (echocardiography and CTCA), and LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (echocardiography).

ResultsLV dysfunction was accurately identified by using either A-ECG (AUC 0.97, 0.89 to 0.99) or NTproBNP. eCS demonstrated accurate discrimination of CAD (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92, p < 0.0001. Troponin I (Abbott/Singulex) had the highest sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of LVH measured by either CT or echocardiography (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92), however specificity was reduced by the presence of LV systolic dysfunction. Metabolomics and A-ECG identified underlying abnormal mechanisms related to both LVH (glycine metabolism) and LV dysfunction, (Citric Acid cycle). Metabolomics provided incidental utility by identifying metformin adherence and nutritional biomarkers.

ConclusionA multi-omic approach to screening can be achieved at relatively low cost, and high accuracy, but will need to be evaluated in larger populations to prove its utility.",NA,medrxiv

Peculiarities of the parameters suggested a classification of the above windows into three categories: (i) whose fitted parameters predicted a rise in the number of active cases before a fall to zero, (ii) which predicted a decrease, without rising, in the active cases to zero and (iii) which predicted an increase in the active cases until the entire susceptible population gets infected. It follows that some of the type (iii) windows are of the same or lesser concern when compared to some type (i) windows.

Such a decision is critical and must take into account, other than its beneficial effects, also those associated with an increased exposition of the students to the virus, which, as a result, might spread at a faster rate. To date, in Italy, a few studies have rigorously investigated the correlation between school reopening and number of people tested positive to CoViD-19. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an assessment of such an impact as well as to illustrate the methodology followed.

MethodsOfficial daily data on the cumulative number of people tested positive to CoViD-19 - in conjunction with external information accounting for the different points in time schools reopened in the various Italian regions - have been employed to build a stochastic model of the type Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average embodying external information.

ResultsThere was a statistically significant increase in the number of positive cases in all the Italian regions related to schools reopening. Such an increase occurred, in average, about 18.9 days after the schools have been reopened. Schools reopening have been significantly contributed to the diffusion of the pandemic, with an overall estimated impact of about 228,724 positive cases.

ConclusionsThe results suggest the need for strict control of all in-school activities. This could be done by using, to a variable extent, all the non-pharmaceutical interventions available, such as limited access to school spaces, no overlapping practices between different sports in the same space, universal masking, bubble-size classroom. However, in many cases, such measures might not be a viable option, at least in the short run, nor be reasonably applicable. Therefore, whenever the established safety criteria could not be met, school buildings should remain closed.

Some studies have eluded to an association between pregnancy status and severe COVID-19 cytokine storm, some, in contrast, have demonstrated such. The aim of the current study was to find the relationship between pregnancy status and clinical COVID-19 severity characterized by cytokine storm through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach.

MethodsWe searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting pregnancy status and comparing the COVID-19 severity cytokine storm outcome were included. The COVID-19 severity characterized by cytokine storm was described using parameters such as; Intensive Care Unit Admission, Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, Mechanical Ventilation, Hospital Admission, Pro and Inflammatory cytokine levels, consolidation on chest CT scan, pulmonary infiltration, extreme fevers as characteristic of cytokine storm, syndromic severity, higher neutrophil count indicative of cytokine storm and severe COVI-19 presentation.

ResultsA total of 17 articles detailing 840332 COVID-19 women were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between positive pregnancy status and severe COVID-19 cytokine storm case (random effect model, OR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.63-3.73; P < 0.0001), with a cumulative incidence of 6432 (14.1%) among the pregnant women with COVID-19 and 24352 (3.1%) among the non-pregnant women with COVI-19. Further to this, we found that the sub-analysis between Single Centre and Multiple Centre studies demonstrated seemingly the same as heterogeneity (I2 = 72 and (I2 = 98), respectively. Sensitivity analysis on each sub-group revealed that pregnancy was significantly related to severe COVID-19 with cytokine storm from single Centre studies, (fixed effect model, OR= 3.97; 95% CI: 2.26-6.95; P< 0.00001) with very low heterogeneity (I2 = 2 %; P = 0.42).

ConclusionBeing pregnant is clearly associated with experiencing a severe COVID-19 characterized by a cytokine storm. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, and map out salient risk factors associated with its severity.

Sensitive tests that effectively predict the disease outcome are essentially required to guide proper intervention.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the predictive ability of serial procalcitonin (PCT) measurement to predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients, using PCT clearance (PCT-c) as a tool to reflect its dynamic changes.

MethodsA prospective observational study of inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Quarantine Hospitals of Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. During the first five days of hospitalization, serial PCT and PCT-c values were obtained and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Patients were followed up to hospital discharge or in-hospital mortality.

ResultsCompared to survivors, serial PCT levels of non-survivors were significantly higher (p [&le;] 0.001) and progressively increased during follow-up. In contrast, PCT-c values were significantly lower (p < 0.01) and progressively decreased. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that using the initial PCT value alone, at a cut-off value of 0.80 ng/ml, the area under the curve for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.81 with 61.1% sensitivity and 87.3% accuracy. Serial measurements showed better predictive performance, and the combined prediction value was better than the single prediction by the initial PCT alone.

ConclusionsSerial PCT measurement could be a helpful laboratory tool to predict the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, PCT-c could be a reliable tool to assess PCT progressive kinetics.",NA,medrxiv

Our objective is to propose a fresh look at this data by coupling a phenomenological description to the epidemiological dynamics.

MethodsWe use a phenomenological model to describe and regularize the data. This model can be matched by a single mathematical model reproducing the epidemiological dynamics with a time-dependent transmission rate. We provide a method to compute this transmission rate and reconstruct the changes in the social interactions between people as well as changes in host-pathogen interactions. This method is applied to the cumulative case data of 8 different geographic areas.

FindingsWe reconstruct the transmission rate from the data, therefore we are in position to understand the contribution of the dynamical effects of social interactions (contacts between individuals) and the contribution of the dynamics of the epidemic. We deduce from the comparison of several instantaneous reproduction numbers that the social effects are the most important in the dynamic of COVID-19. We obtain an instantaneous reproduction number that stays below 3.5 from early beginning of the epidemic.

ConclusionThe instantaneous reproduction number staying below 3.5 implies that it is sufficient to vaccinate 71% of the population in each state or country considered in our study. Therefore assuming the vaccines will remain efficient against the new variants, and to be more confident it is sufficient to vaccinate 75 - 80% to get rid of COVID-19 in each state or country.

The relevance of highly fit, or multi-drug resistant lineages such as ST131 to overall E. coli disease burden remains to be fully determined. We set out to characterise the prevalence of E. coli multi-locus sequence types (MLST) and determine if these were associated with adverse outcomes in an urban population of E. coli bacteraemia patients.

MethodsWe undertook whole genome sequencing of E. coli blood isolates from all patients with diagnosed E. coli bacteraemia in north-west London from July 2015 to August 2016 and assigned multi-locus sequence types to all isolates. Isolate sequence types were linked to routinely collected antimicrobial susceptibility, patient demographic, and clinical outcome data to explore relationships between the E. coli sequence types, patient factors, and outcomes.

FindingsA total of 551 E. coli genomes were available for analysis. More than half of these cases were caused by four E. coli sequence types: ST131 (21%), ST73 (15%), ST69 (9%) and ST95 (8%). E. coli genotype ST131-C2 was associated with non-susceptibility to quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, and also to amoxicillin, augmentin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. An association between the ST131-C2 lineage and longer length-of-stay was detected, although multivariable regression modelling did not demonstrate an association between E. coli sequence type and mortality. However, a number of unexpected associations were identified, including gentamicin non-susceptibility, ethnicity, and sex that might influence mortality and length-of-stay, requiring further research.

InterpretationAlthough E. coli sequence type was associated with antimicrobial non-susceptibility patterns and length-of-stay, we did not find that E. coli sequence type was associated with increased mortality. Where ST131 is prevalent, caution is required when pairing beta-lactam agents with gentamicin or using single agent aminoglycosides.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSE. coli is the leading cause of bacteraemia in adults, with consequent major impact on patient morbidity and mortality, as well as cost of care. Identification of microbial and patient factors that contribute to severity from E. coli bacteraemia could inform clinical guidelines and improve outcomes. We searched PubMed for articles published in English between 1st of Jan 1999 to 3rd of May 2021 using the following terms: (""Escherichia coli"" OR ""E. coli"") AND (""bacteraemia"" OR ""bloodstream infection"") AND (""genotype"" OR ""multi-locus sequence typing"" OR ""MLST""). We screened titles, abstracts, and bibliographies of relevant articles to identify reports that examine microbial factors that influence outcome. Previous studies have examined the association between a narrow range of E. coli lineages carrying specific antimicrobial resistance genes and prior antibiotic consumption, patient comorbidities, and mortality. Only two previous studies have examined the association of a wider range of E. coli sequence types (via MLST or whole genome sequencing) with clinical disease phenotype. We provide an integrated observational analysis of E. coli sequence types, patient demographic data, and disease outcomes.

Added value of this studyWe provide whole genome sequences from an un-biased collection of 551 E. coli strains causing consecutive bloodstream infections (BSI) in a one-year period in London. The study confirms ST131 to be the single leading BSI-causing genotype, albeit accounting for just 21% of infections. Only half of these were from the so-called multi-drug resistant ST131-C2 lineage however, suggesting factors other than antimicrobial resistance alone contribute to fitness of ST131, and other currently dominant lineages. The study provides a valuable resource to link genome sequence to antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and evaluates the contribution of both bacterial sequence type and patient factors to disease outcome. E. coli ST131 subclade C2 was associated with non-susceptibility to multiple antibiotics as well as a longer length-of-stay, underlining a value in sequence-type surveillance, but we did not detect an association with mortality. Multi-variate analysis unexpectedly identified ethnicity as a potential contributor to 90-day mortality, mandating further investigation, while microbial gentamicin resistance was also linked to adverse outcome.

Implications of all available evidenceE. coli bloodstream infections continue to rise in the UK, despite implemented strategies aimed at reducing E. coli invasive infections and antimicrobial resistance. Certain E. coli lineages are more likely to be multidrug-resistant or associated with specific infection types, however a more detailed understanding of changes in these pathogenic lineages over time in vulnerable populations is needed. Although multi-drug resistant lineages such as ST131-C2 contribute to prolonged length-of-stay, factors other than E. coli genotype may have a greater role to play in final outcome. While co-morbidities play a major role in mortality from E. coli bacteraemia, other demographic factors require attention. A more comprehensive analysis of associations between E. coli genotype, patient factors, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and clinical outcomes could inform prescribing guidelines for both urinary tract and invasive E. coli infections. Such information will further serve as a potential driver for developing and implementing lineage-specific E. coli vaccines in the future.",NA,medrxiv

This study aimed to investigate time spent on exercise during leisure time and physical activity, including time at work, in relation to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Japanese workers.

MethodsAn Internet-based national health survey -Collaborative Online Research on Novel-coronavirus and Work study (CoRoNaWork study) - was conducted among 33,087 Japanese workers in December 2020. After excluding invalid responses, 27,036 participants were categorized into four and five groups according to exercise time and physical activity time, respectively. Each groups scores were compared on each of the four questions on the Japanese version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Health-Related Quality of Life (CDC HRQOL-4) between each group using a linear mixed model. Age-sex adjusted and multivariate models were used to compare each index of the CDC HRQOL-4.

ResultsThe more time spent exercising, the better the self-rated health. Self-rated health was better and unhealthy days were fewer in the group that exercised more than a certain amount of time than in the group that spent almost no time on exercising. As for physical activity, the group that spent more than 120 minutes/day or that almost never engaged in physical activity had lower self-rated health. The group with more than 120 minutes/day of physical activity also had more unhealthy days.

ConclusionsThe results of the present study suggest that exercise habits improve workers HRQOL. Interventions to encourage daily exercise even for a short period of time may be an effective strategy to improve workers health and productivity.",NA,medrxiv

There is often a family history of lipoedema, suggesting a genetic origin, but the contribution of genetics is currently unclear. A tightly phenotyped cohort of 200 lipoedema patients was recruited from two UK specialist clinics. Objective clinical characteristics and measures of quality of life data were obtained. In an attempt to understand the genetic architecture of the disease better, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were obtained, and a genome wide association study (GWAS) performed on 130 of the recruits. The analysis revealed genetic loci suggestively associated with the lipoedema phenotype, with further support provided by an independent cohort taken from the 100,000 Genomes Project. Top SNPs included loci associated with lipoma formation, biosynthesis of hormones and lipid hydroxylation.

Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) can help to quantify that risk, but the broader impacts of polygenic risk for CAD are not well characterized.

MethodsWe measured polygenic risk for CAD using the metaGRS, a previously validated genome-wide PRS, in a subset of genotyped participants from the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) and applied a phenome-wide association study framework to assess associations between the PRS and broad range of blood biomarkers, clinical measurements, and outcomes.

ResultsPolygenic risk for CAD was associated with a variety of biomarkers, clinical measurements, behaviors, and diagnoses related to traditional risk factors, as well as risk-enhancing factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a), increased central adiposity, earlier age of menopause, and rheumatoid arthritis. Analysis of adjudicated outcomes showed a graded association between atherosclerosis related outcomes, with the highest odds ratios being observed for the most severe manifestations of CAD. Higher polygenic risk for CAD was also associated with decreased risk for any incident cancer, breast cancer, and invasive breast cancer but a younger age of death.

ConclusionPolygenic risk for CAD has broad clinical manifestations, reflected in biomarkers, clinical measurements, behaviors, and diagnoses. Some of these associations may represent direct pathways between genetic risk and CAD while others may reflect pleiotropic effects independent of CAD risk.",NA,medrxiv

Past studies hypothesize that amyloid deposits damage organs, causing this association. Examining how vascular factors can influence AD pathogenesis can help in understanding the link between the blood to the brain, which can provide alternative paths of exploration for disease treatment. This study analyzes gene expression and shared biological processes between AD and CVD, specifically myocardial infarction and heart failure, via bioinformatic approaches and published datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). First, 73 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among four datasets using blood samples from AD and CVD patients. Panthers Gene Ontology Analysis validated several biological processes such as xylulose biosynthetic process and toll-like receptor TLR1:TLR2 signaling pathway along with molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways to be significantly enriched in the list of 73 DEGs. Analysis of protein-protein interactions and the associated gene network indicated that from the list of 73 DEGs, only six (MAPK14, TLR2, HCK, GRB2, PRKCD, PTPN6) had eight or more degrees. Next, those six genes were identified in a normalized dataset containing different brain regions of AD and non-AD patients. Two-sample t-tests for differences in mean showed statistically significant differences in GRB2 and PRKCD, supporting a blood-brain relationship in the association between AD and CVD.

ObjectiveTo assess whether vulnerable counties have achieved similar rates of coverage to non-vulnerable areas, and how vaccine acceptance varies by vulnerability.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe use population-weighted univariate linear regressions to associate the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) and its 7 constituent themes with a county-level time series of vaccine coverage and vaccine acceptance. We fit a multilevel model to understand how vulnerability within and across states associates with coverage as of May 8, 2021.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index was used as a metric for county-level vulnerability. County-level daily COVID-19 vaccination data on both first doses administered and people fully vaccinated from April 3, 2021 through May 8, 2021 were extracted from the Covid Act Now API. County-level daily COVID-19 vaccine acceptance survey data from January 6, 2021 through May 4, 2021 were obtained via the Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Groups COVIDcast API.

ResultsVulnerable counties have consistently lagged less vulnerable counties. As of May 8, the top third of vulnerable counties in the US had fully vaccinated 11.3% fewer people than the bottom third (30.7% vs 34.6% of adult population; linear regression, p= 2.2e-16), and 12.1% fewer initiated vaccinations (40.1% vs 45.6%; linear regression, p= 2.2e-16)). Six out of seven dimensions of vulnerability, including Healthcare System Factors and Socioeconomic Status, predicted lower coverage whereas the Population Density theme associated with higher coverage. Vulnerable counties have also consistently had a slightly lower level of vaccine acceptance, though as of May 4, 2021 this difference was observed to be only 0.7% between low- and high-vulnerability counties (high: 86.1%, low: 85.5%, p=0.027).

Conclusions and RelevanceThe vaccination gap between vulnerable and non-vulnerable counties is substantial and not readily explained by a difference in acceptance. Vulnerable populations continue to need additional support, and targeted interventions are necessary to achieve similar coverage in vulnerable counties compared to those less vulnerable to COVID-19.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre the US counties most vulnerable to COVID-19 also facing the lowest vaccination coverage?

FindingsUS populations with increased health, social, and economic vulnerabilities have experienced consistently lower vaccination coverage. As of May 8, on average, the top third of vulnerable counties across the US had fully vaccinated 11.3% fewer people than the least vulnerable third. There is only a 0.7% difference in vaccine acceptance between the 2 cohorts..

COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is a potential therapeutic, but there is limited data for patients with moderate-to-severe disease.

Research QuestionWhat are outcomes associated with administration of CCP in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection?

Study Design and MethodsWe conducted a propensity score-matched analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were number of days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days; length of hospital stay; and change in WHO scores from CCP administration (or index date) to discharge. Of 151 patients who received CCP, 132 had complete follow-up data. Patients were transfused after a median of 6 hospital days; thus, we investigated the effect of convalescent plasma before and after this timepoint with 77 early (within 6 days) and 55 late (after 6 days) recipients. Among 3,217 inpatients who did not receive CCP, 2,551 were available for matching.

ResultsEarly CCP recipients, of whom 31 (40%) were on mechanical ventilation, had lower 14-day (15% vs 23%) and 30-day (38% vs 49%) mortality compared to a matched unexposed cohort, with nearly 50% lower likelihood of in-hospital mortality (HR 0.52, [95% CI 0.28-0.96]; P=0.036). Early plasma recipients had more days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days (+3.3 days, [95% CI 0.2 to 6.3 days]; P=0.04) and improved WHO scores at 7 days (-0.8, [95% CI: -1.2 to - 0.4]; P=0.0003) and hospital discharge (-0.9, [95% CI: -1.5 to -0.3]; P=0.004) compared to the matched unexposed cohort. No clinical differences were observed in late plasma recipients.

InterpretationEarly administration of CCP improves outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, while improvement was not observed with late CCP administration. The importance of timing of administration should be addressed in specifically designed trials.",NA,medrxiv

Main outcome measuresSARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of school staff using spike (S)-based testing (unvaccinated staff) or N-based serology testing (vaccinated staff).

ResultsThe incidence of COVID-19 cases among students attending in-person was 9.8 per 1,000 students during the 2020/21 school year (N = 47,280 students), and among staff was 13 per 1,000 since the beginning of the pandemic (N = 7,071 active school staff). In total, 1,689 school staff (64% elementary, 28% secondary, 8.3% school board staff or multiple grades) completed the questionnaire, 78.2% had classroom responsibilities, and spent a median of 17.6 hours in class per week [IQR: 5.0 - 25 hours]. Although 21.5% (363/1,686) reported close contact with a COVID-19 case, only 1.4% (24/1688) of the school staff reported having had a positive viral nucleic acid test.

It is likely that there is substantial heterogeneity in HI responses in COVID-19.

MethodsBlood CRP, ferritin, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts were scored to assess HI (HI5) and combined with a validated measure of generalised medical deterioration (NEWS2) before day 2. Our primary outcome was 28 day mortality from early treatment with dexamethasone stratified by HI5-NEWS2 status.

FindingsOf 1265 patients, high risk of HI (high HI5-NEWS2) (n=367, 29.0%) conferred a strikingly increased mortality (36.0% vs 7.8%; Age adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 5.9; 95% CI 3.6-9.8, p<0.001) compared to the low risk group (n= 455, 36.0%). An intermediate risk group (n= 443, 35.0%) also showed significantly higher mortality than the low risk group (17.6% vs 7.8%), aHR 2.2, p=0.005). Early dexamethasone treatment conferred a 50.0% reduction in mortality in the high risk group (36.0% to 18.0%, aHR 0.56, p=0.007). The intermediate risk group showed a trend to reduction in mortality (17.8% to 10.3%, aHR 0.82, p=0.46) which was not observed in the low risk group (7.8% to 9.2%, aHR 1.4, p =0.31).

InterpretationThe HI5-NEWS2 measured at COVID-19 diagnosis, strongly predicts mortality at 28 days. Significant reduction in mortality with early dexamethasone treatment was only observed in the high risk group. Therefore, the HI5-NEWS2 score could be utilised to stratify randomised clinical trials to test whether intensified anti-inflammatory therapy would further benefit high risk patients and whether alternative approaches would benefit low risk groups. Considering its recognised morbidity, we suggest that early dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed for HI5-NEWS2 low risk individuals with COVID-19 and clinicians should cautiously assess the risk benefit of this intervention.

While masks are known to substantially reduce disease transmission in healthcare settings [1-3], studies in community settings report inconsistent results [4-6].

Investigating the inconsistency within epidemiological studies, we find that a commonly used proxy, government mask mandates, does not correlate with large increases in mask-wearing in our window of analysis. We thus analyse the effect of mask-wearing on transmission instead, drawing on several datasets covering 92 regions on 6 continents, including the largest survey of individual-level wearing behaviour (n=20 million) [7]. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we estimate the effect of both mask-wearing and mask-mandates on transmission by linking wearing levels (or mandates) to reported cases in each region, adjusting for mobility and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

We assess the robustness of our results in 123 experiments spanning 22 sensitivity analyses. Across these analyses, we find that an entire population wearing masks in public leads to a median reduction in the reproduction number R of 25.8%, with 95% of the medians between 22.2% and 30.9%. In our window of analysis, the median reduction in R associated with the wearing level observed in each region was 20.4% [2.0%, 23.3%]1.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of social protests on the number and trend of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in some selected Colombian cities where social protests had more intensity.

MethodsWe performed and interrupted time-series analysis (ITSA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, based on the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia, between March 1 and May 15, 2021, for Bogota, Cali, Barranquilla, Medellin, and Bucaramanga. The ITSA models estimated the effect of social demonstrations on the number and trend of cases for each city by using Newey-West standard errors. ARIMA models assessed the overall pattern of the series and effect of the intervention. We considered May 2, 2021, as the intervention date for the analysis, five days after social demonstrations started in the country.

FindingsDuring the study period the number of cases by city was 1,014,815 for Bogota, 192,320 for Cali, 175,269 for Barranquilla, 311,904 for Medellin, and 62,512 for Bucaramanga. Heterogeneous results were found among cities. Only for the cities of Cali and Barranquilla statistically significant changes in trend of the number of cases were obtained after the intervention: positive in the first city, negative in the second one. None ARIMA models show evidence of abrupt changes in the trend of the series for any city and intervention effect was only significant for Bucaramanga.

InterpretationSocial protests had a heterogeneous effect on the number and trend of COVID-19 cases. Different effects might be related to the epidemiologic moment of the pandemic and the characteristics of the social protests. Assessing the effect of social protests within a pandemic is complex and there are several methodological limitations. Further analyses are required with longer time-series data.",NA,medrxiv

However, the importance of these measures needs to be re-evaluated in the context of a complex and rapidly changing environment that includes vaccines, variants, and waning immunity. Also, recent guidelines from the CDC suggest that vaccinated students do not need to participate in surveillance testing. We used an agent-based SEIR model to evaluate the utility of surveillance testing and quarantine in a fully vaccinated student population where vaccine effectiveness may be impacted by the type of vaccination, the presence of variants, and the loss of vaccine-induced or natural immunity over time. We found that weekly surveillance testing at 90% vaccine effectiveness only marginally reduces viral transmission as compared to no testing. However, at 50%-75% effectiveness, surveillance testing can provide over 10-fold reduction in the number of infections on campus over the course of the semester. We also show that a 10-day quarantine protocol for exposures has limited effect on infections until vaccine effectiveness drops to 50%, and that increased surveillance testing for exposures is at least as effective as quarantine at limiting infections. Together these findings provide a foundation for universities to design appropriate mitigation protocols for the 2021-2022 academic year.",NA,medrxiv

However, its efficacy is debated and toxicity concerns might limit the therapeutic range of this drug. Computational models that aid in balancing efficacy and toxicity would be of great help. Parametrizing models is difficult because the prodrug remdesivir is metabolized to its active form (RDV-TP) upon cell entry, which complicates dose-activity relationships.

Here, we employ a computational model that allows predicting drug efficacy based on the binding affinity of RDV-TP for its target polymerase in SARS-CoV-2. We identify an optimal infusion rate to maximize remdesivir efficacy. We also assess drug efficacy in suppressing both wild-type and resistant strains, and thereby selection of resistance.

Our results differ from predictions using prodrug dose-response curves (pseudo-EC50s). We expect that reaching 90% inhibition (EC90) is insufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in lungs. While standard dosing mildly inhibits viral polymerase and therefore likely reduces morbidity, we also expect selection for resistant mutants for most realistic parameter ranges. To increase efficacy and safeguard against resistance, we recommend continuing remdesivir use with companion antivirals and/or with dosing regimens that substantially increase the levels of RDV-TP.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThis is a population-based household survey conducted every 15 days, between June and September 2020 and January and February 2021. In total, 11 phases were performed. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was identified in venous blood using a lateral flow test, Wondfo Biotech. In the last phase, it was combined with an immunoenzymatic test, Euroimmun. Participants also answered a semi-structured questionnaire on sociodemographic and economic factors and social distancing measures. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were estimated according to the region, Human Development Index, sex, age group, ethnicity, education, income and variables associated with risk or prevention of the infection. To compare the frequencies among the categories of each variable, the chi-square test with Rao Scott correction was used, considering a 5% significance level.

ResultsIn total, 23,397 individuals were interviewed and had their samples collected. The estimated prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 9.7% (95%CI: 7.9-11.8%) to 25.0% (95%CI: 21.7-28.7). The prevalence of individuals with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was higher among black and pardo people, people with lower schooling, people with lower income and among residents of regions with lower Human Development Index. The lowest prevalences were associated with recommended measures of disease protection. The proportion of asymptomatic infection was 45.1%.

ConclusionThe estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower than the cumulative incidence variation, except for the last phase of the study. The differences in prevalence estimates observed among subpopulations showed the social inequality as a risk of infection. The lower prevalence observed among those who could follow prevention measures reinforce the need to maintain the social distancing measures as ways to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",NA,medrxiv

In this study, evaluation of 250 unrelated patients with developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) and a connection on GeneMatcher led to the identification of three de novo missense variants in FZR1. Two variants led to the same amino acid change. All individuals had a DEE with childhood onset generalized epilepsy, intellectual disability, mild ataxia and normal head circumference. Two individuals were diagnosed with the DEE subtype Myoclonic Atonic Epilepsy (MAE). We provide gene burden testing using two independent statistical tests to support FZR1 association with DEE. Further, we provide functional evidence that the missense variants are loss-of-function (LOF) alleles using Drosophila neurodevelopment assays. Using three fly mutant alleles of the Drosophila homolog fzr and overexpression studies, we show that patient variants do not support proper neurodevelopment. With the recent report of a patient with neonatal-onset DEE with microcephaly who also carries a de novo FZR1 missense variant, our study consolidates the relationship between FZR1 and DEE, and expands the associated phenotype. We conclude that heterozygous LOF of FZR1 leads to DEE associated with a spectrum of neonatal to childhood onset seizure types, developmental delay and mild ataxia. Microcephaly can be present but is not an essential feature of FZR1-encephalopathy. In summary, our approach of targeted sequencing using novel gene candidates and functional testing in Drosophila will help solve undiagnosed MAE/DEE cases.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsAn anonymous, cross-sectional online survey was distributed to attendees of a large NF research conference. Respondents self-reported demographics, practice characteristics, awareness of seven NF guideline publications, and level of agreement with up to 40 individual guidelines using a 5-point Likert scale. We calculated the proportion of guidelines that each clinician rated ""strongly agree"", and assessed for differences in guideline awareness and agreement by respondent characteristics.

ResultsSixty-three clinicians (49% female; 80% academic practice) across >8 medical specialties completed the survey. Awareness of each guideline publication ranged from 53%-79% of respondents; specialists had higher awareness of publications endorsed by their medical professional organization (p<0.05). The proportion of respondents who ""strongly agree"" with individual guidelines ranged from 17%-83%; for 16 guidelines, less than 50% of respondents ""strongly agree"".

Importantly, FCD is the most common cause of intractable pediatric focal epilepsy. Gain and loss of function mutations in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway have been identified in this spectrum, with variable levels of mosaicism and tissue distribution. In this study, we aimed to assess droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) as a first-tier molecular diagnostic method, as well as define genotype-phenotype relationships among the most common PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway mutations in FMCD.

A total of 144 specimens, including 113 brain samples, were collected from 58 individuals with intractable focal epilepsy phenotypes including FCD, MEG, HMEG and other types of developmental cortical lesions. We designed an ultra-deep and highly sensitive molecular diagnostic panel using ddPCR for six of the most common mutations in three PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway genes, namely PIK3CA (p.E542K, p.E545K, p.H1047R), AKT3 (p.E17K) and MTOR (p.S2215F, p.S2215Y). We quantified the level of mosaicism across all samples and correlated genotypes with key phenotype, neuroimaging and neuropathological data.

Pathogenic variants were identified in 17 individuals, with an overall molecular solve rate of %. Variant allele fractions (VAF) ranged from 0.1% to 22.67% across all positive samples. Our data shows that MTOR mutations are mostly associated with FCD, whereas PIK3CA mutations are more frequent in the HMEG-DMEG spectrum. The presence of one of these common PI3K-AKT-MTOR-mutations correlated with earlier onset of seizures. However, levels of mosaicism did not correlate with the severity of the cortical malformation by neuroimaging or neuropathological examination. Interestingly, we could not identify the six most common pathogenic variants in other types of cortical lesions (e.g., polymicrogyria or mesial temporal sclerosis) suggesting that PI3K-AKT-MTOR mutations are specifically causal in the FCD-HMEG-MEG spectrum. Finally, our data suggest that ultra-deep targeted molecular analysis for the most common PI3K-AKT-MTOR mutations via ddPCR is an effective molecular diagnostic approach for FMCD phenotypes with a good diagnostic yield when paired with neuroimaging and neuropathology evaluations. The high sensitivity and low DNA input requirements suggests that ddPCR is an effective molecular diagnostic tool for disorders caused by somatic mutations with a narrow mutational spectrum, including specific subtypes of pediatric epilepsy surgical phenotypes such as FCD and HMEG.",NA,medrxiv

Among patients hospitalized for a hypertensive emergency, the observed 30-day all-cause mortality rate decreased from 2.6% to 1.7% and 30-day all-cause readmission rate decreased from 15.7% to 11.8%.

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, hospitalization rates for hypertensive emergencies increased substantially and significantly from 1999 to 2019. Black adults had the largest increase in hospitalization rates across age, sex, race, and dual-eligible strata. There was significant national variation, with the highest rates generally in the South.

However, the potential impact of different treatments, and consequently research and procurement priorities, have not been clear.

Methods and FindingsWe develop a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 disease and clinical care to explore the potential public-health impact of a range of different potential therapeutics, under a range of different scenarios varying: i) healthcare capacity, ii) epidemic trajectories; and iii) drug efficacy in the absence of supportive care. In each case, the outcome of interest was the number of COVID-19 deaths averted in scenarios with the therapeutic compared to scenarios without. We find the impact of drugs like dexamethasone (which are delivered to the most critically-ill in hospital and whose therapeutic benefit is expected to depend on the availability of supportive care such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation) is likely to be limited in settings where healthcare capacity is lowest or where uncontrolled epidemics result in hospitals being overwhelmed. As such, it may avert 22% of deaths in high-income countries but only 8% in low-income countries (assuming R=1.35). Therapeutics for different patient populations (those not in hospital, early in the course of infection) and types of benefit (reducing disease severity or infectiousness, preventing hospitalisation) could have much greater benefits, particularly in resource-poor settings facing large epidemics.

ConclusionsThere is a global asymmetry in who is likely to benefit from advances in the treatment of COVID-19 to date, which have been focussed on hospitalised-patients and predicated on an assumption of adequate access to supportive care. Therapeutics that can feasibly be delivered to those earlier in the course of infection that reduce the need for healthcare or reduce infectiousness could have significant impact, and research into their efficacy and means of delivery should be a priority.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThis was a population-based cross-sectional study, carried out in 8 administrative divisions and 64 districts to estimate the prevalence of stroke throughout the country. The study adopted a two-stage cluster random sampling approach. The calculated sample size was 25,287. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to identify suspected stroke patients who were subsequently confirmed by consultant neurologists.

ResultIn the first stage, Interviewers identified 561 respondents as suspected stroke in 64 districts. Of the 25,287 respondents, 54.9% were male. The mean age was 39.9 years. In the second stage of the study; among all the respondents, 288 were confirmed as stroke patients which provided a prevalence of 11.39 per 1000 population. The highest stroke prevalence (14.71 per thousand) was found in the Mymensingh division and the lowest (7.62 per thousand) found in the Rajshahi division. It was 30.10 per thousand in the age group of more than 60 years. The prevalence of stroke among males was twice that of females (13.62 versus 8.68 per thousand). The prevalence was slightly higher in rural areas (11.85 versus 11.07). Out of a total of 288 cases, 79.7% (213) patients had an ischemic stroke, 15.7% (42) had hemorrhagic, and 4.6% (12) were diagnosed as subarachnoid hemorrhage. The majority of the stroke patients had hypertension (79.2%), followed by dyslipidemia (38.9%), tobacco use in any form (37.2%), diabetes (28.8%), ischemic heart disease (20.1%).

ConclusionWe have found a stroke prevalence of 11.39 per 1000 population, the highest being in the Mymensingh division. The prevalence was much higher in the elderly and male population. More than three fourth had an ischemic stroke. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, diabetes, ischemic heart disease are the most common risk factors observed among stroke patients.

Summary BoxAlready Known:

{blacksquare}The prevalence of stroke in Bangladesh was found to be 3 per thousand.
{blacksquare}Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and ischemic heart disease were common risk factors.

Epidemic waves may result when restrictions are lifted or poorly adhered to, variants with new phenotypic properties successfully invade, or when infection spreads to susceptible sub-populations. Three COVID-19 epidemic waves have been observed in Kenya. Using a mechanistic mathematical model we explain the first two distinct waves by differences in contact rates in high and low social-economic groups, and the third wave by the introduction of a new higher-transmissibility variant. Reopening schools led to a minor increase in transmission between the second and third waves. Our predictions of current population exposure in Kenya ([~]75% June 1st) have implications for a fourth wave and future control strategies.

Cerebral serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) binding measured with positron emission tomography (PET) is inversely related to serotonin levels and can serve as a proxy for brain serotonin levels. We here determine if 5-HT4R differs between healthy and MDD individuals and if it is associated with successful outcomes of serotonergic treatment of MDD. We [11C]-SB207145 PET-scanned 100 (71 F) untreated patients with moderate to severe MDD and 91 (55 F) healthy controls; 40 patients were re-scanned after 8 weeks treatment. All patients started treatment with the SSRI escitalopram and were followed clinically after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Treatment response was measured as change from baseline.

Before treatment, patients with MDD had 8% lower global 5-HT4R binding than controls (95%CI[-13.1%;-2.5%], p<0.001). Non-responders did not differ from controls, whereas remitters had 9% lower binding than controls ([-16.1%;-2.7%], p=0.004). Independent of treatment outcomes, patients reduced their neostriatal 5-HT4R binding (-9%, [-12.8%;-5.0%], p<0.001) after serotonergic intervention.

Overall, patients with MDD have lower cerebral 5-HT4R binding than controls, suggesting that 5-HT4R is a biomarker for MDD. The observation that SSRI treatment leads to reduced neostriatal 5-HT4R binding supports that the treatment does indeed increase brain 5-HT levels. Patients who remit to SSRIs have lower cerebral 5-HT4R prior to treatment than controls whereas non-responders do not differ. We propose that non-responders to SSRIs constitute a subgroup with non-serotonergic depression.

We use the term CEN as a working description to refer to the needs experienced by people who may have been diagnosed with a  personality disorder. Understanding clinician perspectives is vital for service transformation, as their views and experiences shed light on potential barriers to achieving good care, and how these might be overcome. In this study, we aimed to explore these views.

MethodsWe used a qualitative interview design. A total of fifty participants from a range of professions across specialist and generic community mental health services across England who provide care to people with CEN took part in six focus groups and sixteen one-to-one interviews. We analysed the data using a thematic approach.

FindingsMain themes were: 1) Defining Best Practice, 2) Facilitators of Best Care, 3) Barriers to Best Care, 4) Systemic Challenges. Across these themes, staff highlighted in particular the need for care that was person-centred, relational, empathic, and trauma informed. However, major barriers to achieving this are stigmatising attitudes and behaviour towards people with CEN, especially in generic mental health services, lack of development of coherent service systems offering clear long-term pathways and ready access to high quality treatment, and lack of well-developed structures for staff training and support.

DiscussionOverall, the findings point towards clinician views as generally congruent with those of service users, reinforcing the need for priorities towards systemwide change to ensure that we can provide the best practice care for these individuals. Particularly prominent is the need to put in place system-wide training and support for clinicians working with CEN, encompassing generic as well as specialist services, and to challenge the stigma still experienced throughout the system.

DesignCross-sectional design involving analysis of three DHS (2006, 2011, and 2016) in Uganda.

SettingThe data was collected in Uganda. The DHS are nationally representative surveys on a wide range of indicators including contraception knowledge and use.

ParticipantsA total of 8,250 adolescents (15-19 years) and 7,110 young women (20-24 years) were included.

Primary outcome measureUse of LAM among adolescents and young women with a livebirth within six months before each survey.

ResultsIn 2016, less than 1% of eligible adolescents correctly used LAM and 56% were passively benefitting from LAM. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhea (PPA) among adolescents in 2016 was 6.9 months, declining from 8.3 months in 2006. Compared to adolescents, eligible young women had higher knowledge of LAM and higher medianPPA duration in 2016. The percentage of eligible adolescents who met the LAM criteria irrespective of whether they reported LAM use (protected by LAM) decreased from 76% in 2006 to 57% in 2016. More than 50% of eligible adolescents were aware of LAM in 2016, increasing from 6% in 2006, potentially in part due to change in survey question.

ConclusionDespite increasing awareness of LAM, reported and correct use of LAM was low among adolescents who could benefit from this method in Uganda, and declining over time. Support for adolescents to harness the benefits of correct LAM use should be increased. Additional research is needed to better understand the dynamics of LAM use in adolescents, including the transition to use of other modern contraceptive methods.

Strengths and limitations of this study[tpltrtarr] Lactational amenorrhea method has the potential to promote healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies and to reduce repeat adolescent births, yet, its use among Ugandan adolescents has not been examined.
[tpltrtarr]This study provides useful insights into the behavior of adolescents mothers which can be targeted to improve their reproductive knowledge and wellbeing.
[tpltrtarr]The study used data from three standardised nationally representative surveys, thus findings are generalizable and comparable over time and across age groups.

The ARTIC.v3 primer pool that amplifies short amplicons in a multiplex-PCR reaction is one of the most widely used methods for sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that some genomic intervals are poorly captured with ARTIC primers. To improve the genomic coverage and variant detection across these intervals, we designed long amplicon primers and evaluated the performance of a short (ARTIC) plus long amplicon (MRL) sequencing approach. Sequencing assays were optimized on VR-1986D-ATCC RNA followed by sequencing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from five COVID-19 positive patients. ARTIC data covered >90% of the virus genome fraction in the positive control and four of the five patient samples. Variant analysis in the ARTIC data detected 67 mutations, including 66 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and one deletion in ORF10. Of 66 SNVs, five were present in the spike gene, including nt22093 (M177I), nt23042 (S494P), nt23403 (D614G), nt23604 (P681H), and nt23709 (T716I). The D614G mutation is a common variant that has been shown to alter the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. Two spike protein mutations, P681H and T716I, which are represented in the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, were also detected in one patient. Long-amplicon data detected 58 variants, of which 70% were concordant with ARTIC data. Combined analysis of ARTIC +MRL data revealed 22 mutations that were either ambiguous (17) or not called at all (5) in ARTIC data due to poor sequencing coverage. For example, a common mutation in the ORF3a gene at nt25907 (G172V) was missed by the ARTIC assay. Hybrid data analysis improved sequencing coverage overall and identified 59 high confidence mutations for phylogenetic analysis. Thus, we show that while the short amplicon (ARTIC) assay provides good genomic coverage with high throughput, complementation of poorly captured intervals with long amplicon data can significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 genomic coverage and variant detection.",NA,medrxiv

Whilst several large sequencing studies have permitted detailed analysis of the population structure of these isolates in adults, equivalent data is lacking in the paediatric population.

MethodsWe performed an epidemiological and sequencing based analysis of Gram-negative bloodstream infections in children under the age of 18 between 2008 and 2018 in Oxfordshire, UK.

Findings327 isolates (of which 296 were successfully sequenced) from 287 patients were included in the study. The burden of infection in the paediatric population lies predominantly in neonates. Most infections were caused by E. coli/Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter hormaechei. There was no evidence of an increasing incidence of E. coli bloodstream infections and for Klebsiella spp. there was some evidence that the incidence decreased slightly. Similarly the proportion of resistant isolates did not change over time, though we did identify some evidence of sub-breakpoint increases in gentamicin resistance. The population structure of E. coli isolates causing bloodstream infection in neonates and children mirrors that seen in adults. In most cases there was no evidence of transmission between patients/point source acquisition and whole genome sequencing was able to refute a previously suspected outbreak.

ConclusionOur findings support continued use of current empirical treatment guidelines and likely highlight the success of infection control measures in this population. Our data suggest that O-antigen targeted vaccines may have a role in reducing the incidence of neonatal sepsis, potentially by vaccination of pregnant women. Clinical trials to further investigate this possibility are warranted.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed to compare RMR-TB with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) within a high TB, RR-TB and HIV burden setting. Patient-level clinical data and stored RR-TB isolates from 2008-2017 with available whole genome sequencing (WGS) data were used to describe risk factors associated with RMR-TB and to compare rifampicin-resistance (RR) conferring mutations between RMR-TB and MDR-TB. A subset of isolates with particular RR-conferring mutations were subjected to semi-quantitative rifampicin phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Among 2,041 routinely diagnosed RR-TB patients, 463 (22.7%) had RMR-TB. HIV-positive individuals (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) and diagnosis between 2013-2017 versus 2008-2012 (aOR 1.3, 1.1-1.7) were associated with RMR-TB. Among 1,119 (54.8%) patients with available WGS data showing RR-TB, significant differences in the distribution of rpoB RR-conferring mutations between RMR-TB and MDR-TB isolates were observed. Mutations associated with high-level RR were more commonly found among MDR-TB isolates (811/889, 90.2% versus 162/230, 70.4% among RMR-TB, p<0.01). In particular, the rpoB L430P mutation, conferring low-level RR, was identified in 32/230 (13.9%) RMR-TB versus 10/889 (1.1%) in MDR-TB (p<0.01). Among 10 isolates with an rpoB L430P mutation, 7 were phenotypically susceptible using the critical concentration of 0.5 {micro}g/ml (range 0.125-1 {micro}g/ml). The majority (215/230, 93.5%) of RMR-TB isolates showed susceptibility to all other TB drugs, highlighting the potential benefits of WGS for simplified treatment.

Here we compare methods to store samples, inactivate viruses, capture/concentrate viruses, and extract/measure viral RNA from primary influent into wastewater facilities. We found that heat inactivation of the viruses led to a 1-3 log10 decrease compared to chemical inactivation. Freezing influent prior to concentration caused a 1-4 log10 decrease compared to processing fresh samples, but viral capture by membrane adsorption prior to freezing was robust to freeze-thaw variability. Concentration vs. direct extraction, and PCR platform also affected outcome, but by a smaller amount. The choice of nucleocapsid gene target had nearly no effect. Pepper mild-mottle virus was much less sensitive to these methodological differences than was SARS-CoV-2, which challenges its use as a population-level control among studies using different methods.

AimsTo clinically define and biologically validate a subgroup of aMCI subjects that take up an intermediate position between controls and AD patients.

MethodsIn 61 healthy controls, 60 subjects with aMCI, and 60 AD patients we measured the features of aMCI/AD using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD). A composite BIORISK score was computed using the ApoE4 allele, serum folate, albumin, white blood cells, fasting blood glucose (FBG), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), T2DM and hypertension.

ResultsClustering and nearest neighbour analyses were unable to validate the aMCI subgroup. We constructed two z unit-based composite scores, the first indicating overall burden of cognitive, social, and behavioural deterioration (OBD), and a second reflecting the interactions between ApoE4, all other biomarkers, hypertension and T2DM (BIORISK). We found that 40.2% of the variance in the OBD score was explained by BIORISK, ApoE4, age and education. The OBD index was used to construct three subgroups (normal, medium, and high OBD) with the medium group (n=45) showing mild cognitive dysfunctions (MCD) in memory, language, orientation, and ADL. People with MCD show OBD and BIORISK scores that are significantly different from controls and AD.

SettingThis study involved 2 academic hospital (a tertiary and secondary center) in Surabaya, Indonesia.

ParticipantsPregnant women at a high risk of developing PE were recruited and randomized into an intervention group (40) and a control group (40). The inclusion criteria consisted of pregnant women with positive clinical risk factor and abnormal uterine artery doppler examination at 10-20 weeks gestational age.

InteventionsThe control group received low dose aspirin (80 mg/day) and calcium (1 g/day), while the intervention group received additional pravastatin (20 mg twice daily) starting from 14-20 weeks gestation until delivery. Research blood samples were collected before the first dose of pravastatin, and just before delivery.

Primary and Secondary OutcomesThe primary outcome was the rate of maternal preeclampsia, secondary outcomes included maternal-perinatal outcomes and sFlt-1, PLGF, sFlt-1/PlGF ratio and sEng levels.

ResultsThe rate of preeclampsia was (non-significantly) lower in the pravastatin group compared with the control group (17.5% vs 35%). The pravastatin group also had a (non-significant) lower rate of severe preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, acute kidney injury and severe hypertension. The rate of (iatrogenic) preterm delivery was significantly lower (p 0.048) in the pravastatin group (n=4) compared with the controls (n=12). Neonates in the pravastatin group had significantly higher birthweights, higher Apgar scores, and lower composite neonatal morbidity and NICU admission rates. All biomarkers show a significant deterioration in the control group compared with non-significant changes in the pravastatin group.

ConclusionsPravastatin holds promise in the secondary prevention of preeclampsia and placenta-mediated adverse perinatal outcomes by improving the anti-angiogenic/pro-angiogenic imbalance.

In this study we examined whether subnational (urban-rural) prioritization may affect the cumulative two-year impact on disease transmission and burden of a vaccination campaign using an agent-based model of COVID-19 in a representative Sub-Saharan Africa country setting. We simulated a range of vaccination strategies that differed by urban-rural prioritization, age group prioritization, timing of introduction, and final coverage level. Urban prioritization averted more infections in only a narrow set of scenarios, when internal migration rates were low and vaccination was started by day 30 of an outbreak. Rural prioritization was the optimal strategy for all other scenarios, e.g., with higher internal migration rates or later start dates, due to the presence of a large immunological naive rural population. Among other factors, timing of the vaccination campaign was important to determining maximum impact, and delays as short as 30 days prevented larger campaigns from having the same impact as smaller campaigns that began earlier. The optimal age group for prioritization depended on choice of metric, as prioritizing older adults consistently averted more deaths across all of the scenarios. While guidelines exist for these latter factors, urban-rural allocation is an orthogonal factor that we predict to affect impact and warrants consideration as countries plan the scale-up of their vaccination campaigns.",NA,medrxiv

The current follow-up of the children, now aged 6 to 8 years, aims to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between these levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and neuropsychological functioning, facial dysmorphology, and brain structure & function.

Findings to dateOver half (59%) of mothers consumed some alcohol during pregnancy, with one in five reporting at least one binge drinking episode prior to pregnancy recognition. Childrens craniofacial shape was examined at 12 months of age, and low to moderate prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with subtle midface changes. At two years of age, formal developmental assessments showed no evidence that cognitive, language or motor outcome was associated with any of the prenatal alcohol exposures investigated.

ParticipantsBetween June 2018 and April 2021, 802 of the 1342 eligible AQUA study families completed a parent-report questionnaire (60%). Restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic disrupted recruitment, but early school-age neuropsychological assessments were undertaken with 696 children (52%), and 482 (36%) craniofacial images were collected. A pre-planned, exposure-representative subset of 146 random children completed a brain MRI. The existing AQUA study biobank was extended through collection of 427 (32%) child buccal swabs.

Future plansWe will investigate the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and specific aspects of neurodevelopment at 6-8 years, including brain structure & function. We will also determine whether craniofacial changes identified at 12 months of age are predictive of later developmental impairments. The contribution of genetics and epigenetics to individual variations in outcomes will be examined in conjunction with established and future national and international collaborations.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONSO_LIThe Asking Questions about Alcohol in Pregnancy (AQUA) cohort study was specifically designed to prospectively collect high-quality data on low to moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and relevant confounders to investigate the risk to offspring neurodevelopment.

Most data on adherence to these behaviours is collected via self-reporting, which can differ from observed behaviours. We quantified this discrepancy among a university sample and tested the impact of simple intervention on observed behaviour.

Study designCross-sectional questionnaire of behaviour on campus compared to direct observation on one day without, and one day with, additional signage.

MethodsWe circulated an email inviting all staff and students at our university to complete a questionnaire asking how often they wear a mark or practice hand hygiene when entering campus buildings, and how often they practiced social distancing within campus buildings. We observed all entrants to the main building on one campus on a baseline day and on a day after installing a large sign reminding people that these behaviours were mandatory.

ResultsIn our survey, 172 out of 252 respondents (68%) reported always cleaning their hands, 225 out of 251 (90%) reported always wearing a face covering, and 124 out of 252 (49%) reported always maintaining social distancing. On the baseline day of observation, 50 out of 311 people (16.1%) cleaned their hands and 256 (82.3%) wore a face covering correctly. Out of 119 people whom we could assess, 9 (7%) maintained social distance from others. The signage was associated with significant improvements for cleaning hands (104 / 375 people: 27.7%), wearing a face covering (374 / 375; 99.8%) and maintaining social distance (79 / 144; 54.8%).

However, these were less stringent than other nations. It has not been assessed whether soft containment policies were sufficiently effective in promoting social distancing or reducing human contact.

MethodsUtilising the Google mobility index to assess social distancing behaviour in all Japanese prefectures between 15 February 2020 and 25 June 2021, mobility changes were assessed by an interrupted time-series analysis after adjusting for seasonality and various prefecture-specific fixed-effects and distinguishing potential heterogeneity across multiple SoEs and time passed after the declaration.

ResultsThe mobility index for retail and recreation showed an immediate decline after the declaration of the SoE by 9.29 percent-points (95%CI: -10.23 to -8.35) and a further decline after the initial period (beta: -1.03, 95%CI: -1.20 to -0.87), but gradually increased by 0.02 percent-points (95%CI: 0.02 - 0.03). This trend was similar for mobilities in other places. Among the three SoEs, the overall decline in human mobility outside the home in the third SoE was the least significant, suggesting that people were less compliant with social distancing measures during this period.

ConclusionAlthough less stringent government responses to the pandemic may help promote social distancing by controlling human mobilities outside the home, their effectiveness may decrease if these interventions are repeated and enforced for extended periods, distorting ones health belief by heuristics biases. By combining these with other measures (i.e. risk-communication strategies), even mild containment and closure policies can be effective in curbing the spread of the virus.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIt has been shown that human mobility, in terms of tracing social distancing and human contact in places such as shops, restaurants, and workplaces, was reported to be a useful indicator for predicting COVID-19 outbreaks. Also, previous studies have shown that containment and closure policies, such as country lockdowns and a State of Emergency (SoE) declarations, effectively reduce human mobility. However, it is not explicitly known whether longer and repeated  alerts requesting citizens to avoid nonessential activities with risk communication strategies are equally effective.

Added-value of this studyThis study first evaluated if longer and repeated SoEs were effective to reduce human mobility, suggesting three main findings. First, individuals engage in social distancing behaviours during the initial periods of the SoE but become less compliant as time passes. Second, when mobility changes during each SoE were distinguished, overall declines in mobilities outside the home and increases in stay-at-home time were less obvious during the succeeding SoEs. Third, under the stringent government responses to the pandemic and decline in mobilities, the consumption level--especially for activities outside the home-- sharply declined, suggesting that strong public interventions may worsen the economy.

Implications of all the available evidenceWhile less stringent government responses to the pandemic are effective in promoting social distancing by controlling human mobilities outside the home, their effectiveness may decrease if similar interventions are repeated for extended periods of time. However, by combining these with other measures such as risk-communication strategies, even less costly interventions such as mild containment and closure policies can be effective in curbing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.",NA,medrxiv

With DBM being a new phenomenon in research, little is known about its etiology, operational definitions and risk factors influencing its manifestation. The proposed scoping review is aimed at mapping literature with regards to the DBM phenomenon among preschool children and women of reproductive age in LMICs who are among the most high-risk groups to encounter DBM.

MethodsA comprehensive literature search will be conducted in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS and ProQuest Dissertations & Thesis Global. Additionally, searches in other government and institutional sources (World Health Organization website and university repositories) and forward and backward citation tracking of seminal articles will also be done. Two reviewers will independently conduct title and abstract screening and full text screening. Similarly, data extraction and coding will independently be done by two reviewers. Information extracted from included literature will be analysed qualitatively using thematic analysis approach and reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines.

Ethics and DisseminationEthical approval is not required for this study because the review is based on literature from publicly available sources. The dissemination of our findings will be done through presentations in relevant conferences and publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Strengths and limitationsO_LITo the best of our knowledge, this is the first scoping review that focuses on exploring the etiology of the double burden of malnutrition among preschool children and women of reproductive age in Low-and Middle-Income Countries.
C_LIO_LIThis review will encompass comprehensive literature search and will utilize a renowned thematic analysis framework to synthesis the findings of the study.
C_LIO_LIThe findings of this review will be important in not only mapping the current literature with regards to the double burden of malnutrition phenomenon for risk populations but also guiding secondary data analysis for our subsequent studies.
C_LIO_LIThe anticipated dearth of causation literature and longitudinal studies in this area of research may limit our findings, specifically in understanding the etiology of double burden of malnutrition.

We conducted serosurveillance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit in three health facilities in eastern Ethiopia.

We collected data using questionnaire and a blood sample from 3,312 pregnant women between April 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021 at health facilities in Haramaya, Aweday and Harar. We selected 1,447 blood samples at random and assayed these for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at Hararghe Health Research laboratory using WANTAI(R) SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test for total immunoglobulin. Temporal trends in seroprevalence were analysed with a {chi}2 test for trend and multivariable binomial regression.

Among 1,447 sera tested, 83 were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies giving a crude seroprevalence of 5.7% (95% CI 4.6%, 7.0%). Of 160 samples tested in April-May, 2020, none was seropositive; the first seropositive sample was identified in June and seroprevalence rose steadily thereafter ({chi}2 test for trend, p=0.003) reaching a peak of 11.8% in February, 2021. In the multivariable model, seroprevalence was approximately 3% higher in first-trimester mothers compared to later presentations, and rose by 0.75% (95% CI 0.31%, 1.20%) per month of calendar time.

This clinical convenience sample illustrates the dynamic of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in young adults in eastern Ethiopia; infection was rare before June 2020 but it spread in a linear fashion thereafter, rather than following intermittent waves, and reached 10% by the beginning of 2021.

We built an arterial age predictor by training deep learning models to predict age from 233,388 pulse wave analysis records, 8,279 carotid ultrasound images and arterial health biomarkers (e.g blood pressure) collected from 502,000 UKB participants. We predicted age with a R-Squared of 67.1+/-0.6% and a root mean squared error of 4.29+/-0.04 years. Attention maps for carotid ultrasound images suggest that the predictions are driven by vascular features, for the largest part. Accelerated arterial aging is 32.6+/-7.3% GWAS-heritable, and we identified 192 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 109 genes (e.g NPR3, involved in blood volume and pressure) significantly associated with this phenotype. Similarly, we identified biomarkers (e.g electrocardiogram features), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking) and socioeconomic (e.g income and education) variables associated with accelerated arterial aging. Finally, carotid ultrasound images, pulse wave analysis records and blood pressure biomarkers capture different facets of arterial aging. For example, carotid ultrasound-measured and pulse wave analysis-measured accelerated arterial aging phenotypes are only .164+/-.009 correlated. In conclusion, our predictor suggests potential lifestyle and therapeutic interventions to slow arterial aging, and could be used to assess the efficiency of emerging rejuvenating therapies on the arterial system.",NA,medrxiv

Analysing data in electronic medical record (eMR) systems can assist in understanding clinical workflows, improving care quality, and promoting efficiency in the healthcare system. This study aims to assess timeliness of completion of an electronic nursing admission assessment form and identify patient and facility factors associated with form completion in three metropolitan hospitals.

Materials and MethodsRecords of 37,512 adult inpatient admissions (November 2018-November 2019) were extracted from the hospitals eMR system. A dichotomous variable descriptive of completion of the nursing assessment form (Yes/No) was created. Timeliness of form completion was calculated as the interval between date and time of admission and form completion. Univariate and multivariate multilevel logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with form completion.

ResultsAn admission assessment form was completed for 78.4% (n=29,421) of inpatient admissions. Of those, 78% (n=22,953) were completed within the first 24 hours of admission, 13.3% (n=3,910) between 24-72 hours from admission, and 8.7% (n=2558) beyond 72 hours from admission. Patient length of hospital stay, admission time, and admitting units nursing hours per patient day were associated with form completion. Patient gender, age, and admitting unit type were not associated with form completion.

DiscussionForm completion rate was high, though more emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of timely completion to allow for adequate patient care planning. Staff education, qualitative understanding of delayed form completion, and streamlined guidelines on nursing admission and eMR use are recommended.

This study aimed to determine the clinical pharmacy services provided in public sector hospitals in Nigeria.

MethodsThis was an online survey of 296 primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals sampled purposively across the 36 States and Federal Capital Territory in Nigeria. Data analysis was conducted descriptively, and via Chi-square test and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).

Key findingsResponses were obtained from 272 hospitals in the country with a survey completion rate of 88%. This included 55 tertiary, 72 secondary, and 145 primary healthcare centres (PHCs). Pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care services in all the tertiary care hospitals, 94% of the secondary, and in only 6% of the PHCs surveyed. The composition of the pharmacy department per level of care was similar across the six geopolitical regions (V = 0.383, F = 1.453, P = 0.06) with more pharmacy staff employed in the tertiary care hospitals compared to the secondary care facilities. The majority ([&ge;]75%) of the tertiary and secondary care hospitals provided medicines information, patient education and counselling, alongside in- and outpatient dispensing services. However, fewer than 30% reported routine pharmacists involvement in multidisciplinary ward rounds, medication chart review, therapeutic guidelines development, antibiotic stewardship programmes, and drug therapy monitoring. Pharmacists routinely provided medication error reporting services in only about half of the hospitals in the sample, and this was not associated with the level of care (p > 0.05).

ConclusionsThe findings of this study demonstrate disparity in clinical pharmacy service availability across the various levels of care in Nigeria. It also highlights the need to scale up and prioritize their integration within the primary care sector.",NA,medrxiv

However, it remains unknown how long the protection can maintain and how efficiently it can protect people from the reinfection of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we evaluated the sera from 248 COVID-19 convalescents around one year post-infection in Wuhan, the earliest epicenter of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) maintains at a high level and potently neutralizes the infection of the original strain (WT) and the B.1.1.7 variant in most patients. However, they showed varying degrees of efficacy reduction against the other variants of concern (P.1, B.1.525, and especially B.1.351) in a patient-specific manner. Mutations in RBD including K417N, E484K, and E484Q/L452R (B.1.617) remarkably impair the neutralizing activity of the convalescents sera. Encouragingly, we found that a small fraction of patients sera showed broad neutralization potency to multiple variants and mutants, suggesting the existence of broadly neutralizing antibodies recognizing the epitopes beyond the mutation sites. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectiveness relies more on the timely re-administration of the epitope-updated vaccine than the durability of the neutralizing antibodies.",NA,medrxiv

Evidence on the side effects, complications of therapy and effectiveness of this therapy is lacking or conflicting.

MethodsAdults with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir were compared with propensity-score matched controls, identified from the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol study of UK hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir patients were matched to controls according to baseline underlying 14-day mortality risk. The effect of remdesivir on short-term outcomes was investigated (primary outcome: 14-day mortality). Effect sizes were estimated and adjusted for potential confounders using multivariable modelling.

Results1,549 patients given remdesivir and 4,964 matched controls were identified satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The balance diagnostic threshold was achieved. Patients had symptoms for a median of 6 days prior to baseline; 62% were male, with mean (SD) age 63.1 (15.6) years, and 80% categorised as  White ethnicity. Fourteen-day mortality was not statistically significantly associated with treatment (9.3 % remdesivir vs. 11.9% controls, odds-ratio 0.80, [95% CI 0.60-1.07], p=0.116, adjusted for age, sex, number of key comorbidities, dexamethasone use, and diagnosis of viral pneumonia.

FindingsTreatment with remdesivir was not associated with a reduction in mortality in our primary endpoint at 14 days.

InterpretationRemdesivir did not significantly improve mortality in this study. The findings are subject to the limitations of an observational study. Balance was achieved for measured baseline factors, but unmeasured confounders may account for observed treatment effect sizes.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAt the time of designing this study, two clinical trials measuring the efficacy of remdesivir as a therapeutic in treating SARS COV-2 had published results: ACTT-1 and SOLIDARITY. ACTT-1 suggested that for those who required supplemental oxygen but not ventilation at baseline, remdesivir reduced time-to-recovery (rate ratio 1.45, [95% CI: 1.19-1.79]), improved clinical status at 15 days (proportional odds ratio 1.6 [1.2-2.3]), and improved mortality by both 15 days (hazard ratio 0.28 [0.12-0.66]) and 29 days (0.30 [0.14-0.64]) compared with a placebo. SOLIDARITY did not find any evidence of benefit for remdesivir in these same types of patients - it reported on time-to-recovery, and 28-day mortality, compared with the local standard of care.

Added value of this studyThis study presents real-world data on the effectiveness of remdesivir use during a non-surge phase of the pandemic in the UK, specifically looking at patients for whom the ACTT-1 trial suggested would be most likely to benefit from remdesivir.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe show that during the pandemic, remdesivir was given to a wide demographic of patients in the UK (on average older than those in clinical trials). At 14-days post baseline no reduction in absolute mortality was observed. Propensity score matching achieved balance for measured baseline variables. However as with all observational studies, differences between the groups in unmeasured variables that may influence clinicians but were not recorded in our study, are plausible.",NA,medrxiv

However, substantial uncertainty remains whether tocilizumabs effect is similar across clinically relevant subgroups. Whether this uncertainty can be resolved with Bayesian methods is unknown.

Design, Setting, Participants, and InterventionsRECOVERY was a controlled, open-label, platform UK trial that randomized (1:1) 4116 adults with oxygen saturation <92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy with C-reactive protein [&ge;]75 mg/L to either usual care or tocilizumab plus usual care.

Main outcome measuresMortality and hospital discharge within 28 days.

MethodsUsing Bayesian methods, we combined RECOVERY with evidence-based priors in-corporating previous COVID-19 tocilizumab RCTs. The probability of tocilizumabs benefit for respiratory support and corticosteroid subgroups and sensitivity analyses were performed with different prior distributions and baseline risks.

ResultsFor all-cause mortality, the posterior probabilities of decreased deaths with tocilizumab were >99% and 19% in patients using and not using corticosteroids, respectively. In patients on simple oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, the probabilities of decreased mortality were 96%, >99% and 77%, respectively. The probabilities for a clinically significant mortality reduction, as assessed by an absolute risk difference > 3% (number needed to treat [&le;] 33), were 77%, 96%, 56%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the uncertainty and lack of conclusive evidence for tocilizumabs effect in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation and those without concurrent corticosteroids. Posterior probabilities of benefit for hospital discharge outcome were high and consistent across most subgroups.

ConclusionsIn this Bayesian reanalysis, COVID-19 hospitalized patients exposed to corticosteroids or on non-invasive ventilation have a high probability of a clinically meaningful mortality benefit from tocilizumab. Tocilizumab also likely improves discharge from hospital in most subgroups. Future research should further address if patients on invasive mechanical ventilation can also benefit from tocilizumab.",NA,medrxiv

Between March 28th and July 14th, international air traffic was interrupted and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was brought under control, with only 62 cases recorded. The main challenge for reopening the air border without requiring travelers to quarantine on arrival was to limit the risk of re-introducing SARS-CoV-2. Specific measures were implemented, including the obligation for all travelers to have a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 carried out within 3 days before departure, and to perform another RT-PCR testing 4 days after arrival. Because of limitation in available medical staff, travelers were provided a kit allowing self-collection of oral and nasal swabs. In addition to increase our testing capacity, self-collected samples from up to 10 travelers were pooled before RNA extraction and RT-PCR testing. When a pool tested positive, RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed on each individual sample. We report here the results of COVID-19 surveillance (COV-CHECK PORINETIA) conducted between July 15th, 2020, and February 15th, 2021, in travelers using self-collection and pooling approaches. We tested 5,982 pools comprising 59,490 individual samples, and detected 273 (0.46%) travelers positive for SARS-CoV-2. A mean difference of 1.17 Ct (CI 95% 0.93 - 1.41) was found between positive individual samples and pools (N=50), probably related to the volume of samples used for RNA extraction (200 {micro}L versus 50 {micro}L, respectively). Retrospective testing of positive samples self-collected from October 20th, 2020, using variants-specific amplification kit and spike gene sequencing, found at least 6 residents infected by the B1.1.7 UK variant.

While immunological correlates of disease severity have been identified, how they act together to determine the outcomes is unknown. Here, using a new mathematical model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyze diverse clinical datasets and predict that a subtle interplay between innate and CD8 T-cell responses underlies disease heterogeneity. Our model considers essential features of these immune arms and immunopathology from cytokines and effector cells. Model predictions provided excellent fits to patient data and, by varying the strength and timing of the immune arms, quantitatively recapitulated viral load changes in mild, moderate, and severe disease, and death. Additionally, they explained several confounding observations, including viral recrudescence after symptom loss, prolonged viral positivity before cure, and mortality despite declining viral loads. Together, a robust conceptual understanding of COVID-19 outcomes emerges, bearing implications for interventions.

MethodsKlebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from 195 patients with bloodstream infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2017 in the north of Henan Province, Phoenix100 blood culture and identification system were used for bacterial identification and drug sensitivity test was used for antibiotic resistance detection, and WHONET 5.6 software was used for data analysis of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic sensitivity; the medical history of patients, antibiotic use and laboratory examination results of 195 cases of patients with bloodstream infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae were also retrospectively analyzed.

ResultsThe patients with bloodstream infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae were mainly distributed in ICU, surgical department and Internal medicine department. There were 110 patients with bloodstream infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae accompanied with underlying diseases, accounting for 56.41% in 195 patients with bloodstream infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 87 (87/110, 77.3%) patients accompanied with hypertension and diabetes. Drug sensitivity test showed that in 195 patients with bloodstream infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, the top three antibiotics of the drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae were cefazolin (74%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (70.1%), ampicillin /sulbactam (68.5%); the lower three antibiotics of drug resistance rate were imipenem (52%), cefepime (53%) and amikacin (33%); there were 81 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae produced ESBLs, accounting for 41.53% in 195 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The drug resistance rate of ESBLs positive strains was significantly higher than that of ESBL negative strains. It should be pointed out that the resistance of ESBLs positive strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae to cefazole reached 100%, followed by gentamicin (71.4%), ciprofloxacin (70.4%) and levofloxacin (69.1%); The resistance of ESBLs negative strains to cefazole was 18.2%, followed by gentamicin (3.5%), ciprofloxacin (3.0%) and levofloxacin (19.3%).

ConclusionsThe number of total bacteria isolated from departments with large number of patients is relatively large, and the number of pneumonia patients caused by Klebsiella is also increased; ESBLs positive strains in this hospital are still the main reasons for the drug resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae, reducing the antibiotics use of cefazol, gentamycin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin can effectively reduce the resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the hospital. At the same time, we should pay attention to some contraindications for treating hypertension, diabetes drugs and antibiotics; the clinical staff should pay attention to the timely blood culture test, rational drug use can reduce the emergence of drug-resistant strains and prevent the outbreak of nosocomial infection.",NA,medrxiv

There are limited and conflicting data from immunogenicity studies on the effects of age, gender, vaccination side effects (VSE), risk factors for severe COVID-19 (RFS-COV), obesity (BMI) and previous SARS-CoV-2 (Pr-CoV) Moreover, immunogenicity data from COVID-19 patients comparing various disease categories of natural infection i.e. asymptomatic vs mild vs moderate vs severe infection are sparse, and include limited number of individuals.

This study included 871 vaccinated health care workers (HCW) and 181 patients with natural infection. Immunogenicity was assessed by a quantative assay measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 against the RBD domain of the spike protein (anti-RBD) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 against nucleocapsid protein (anti-N). Samples were collected 1-2 weeks after completion of the 2nd dose in the vaccinated HCWs and 15-59 days post symptoms onset in patients with natural infection.

The concentration of anti-RBD in vaccinated individuals after multivariable analysis was significantly associated with age, gender, VSE and Pr-CoV. Specifically, anti-RBD median levels (95% CI) were lower by 2,466 (651-5,583), 6,228 (3,254-9,203) and 7,651 (4,479-10,823) AU/ml in 35-44, 45-54, 55-70 yrs respectively, compared with 18-34 yrs group. In females, median levels of anti-RBD were higher by 2,823 (859-4,787) compared with males, in individuals with VSE were higher by 5,024 (3,122-6,926) compared with no VSE, and in HCWs with Pr-CoV were higher by 9,971 (5,158-14,783) AU/ml compared with HCWs without Pr-CoV.

Among individuals with natural infection, the median anti-RBD levels were 14.8 times higher in patients with critical COVID-19 infection compared with non-hospitalized individuals. The ratio of anti-RBD in vaccinated individuals versus those with natural infection varied from 1.0 up to 19.4 according to the clinical subgroup of natural infection.

This study proves the high immunogenicity of BNT162b2 vaccine although its sustainability remains to be seen.

We further used Lasso penalized regression to construct a metabolomics risk score (MRS) that predicts MCI, potentially identifying a different set of metabolites than those discovered in individual-metabolite analysis.

RESULTSWe identified 20 metabolites associated with MCI and/or global cognitive change. Six of them were novel and 14 were previously reported as associated with neurocognitive aging outcomes. The MCI MRS comprised 61 metabolites and improved prediction accuracy from 84% (minimally adjusted model) to 89% in the entire dataset and from 75% to 87% among APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) describes the severe lung injury, which is pathologically associated with alveolar damage, inflammation, non-cardiogenic edema, and hyaline membrane formation. Because proteostatic pathways play central roles in cellular protection, immune modulation, protein degradation and tissue repair, we examined the pathological features for the unfolded protein response (UPR) using the surrogate biomarker glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. At autopsy, immunostaining of COVID-19 lungs showed highly elevated expression of GRP78 in both pneumocytes and macrophages compared to non-COVID control lungs. GRP78 expression was detected in both SARS-CoV-2 infected and un-infected pneumocytes as determined by multiplexed immunostaining for nucleocapsid protein. In macrophages, immunohistochemical staining for GRP78 from deceased COVID-19 patients was increased but overlapped with GRP78 expression taken from surgical resections of non-COVID-19 controls. In contrast, the robust in situ GRP78 immunostaining of pneumocytes from COVID-19 autopsies exhibited no overlap and was independent of age, race/ethnicity and gender compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Our findings bring new insights for stress-response pathways involving the proteostatic network implicated for host resilience and suggest that targeting of GRP78 expression might afford an alternative therapeutic strategy to modulate host-viral interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infections.",NA,medrxiv

Clinical research often requires extra encounters with patients, is costly, takes place in an artificial situation with a biased selection of patients, and entails long delays until new evidence is implemented into health care. Electronic health records (EHR) contain detailed information on real patients and cover the entirety of patients. However, the use of EHR for research is limited because they are not standardized between hospitals. This leads to disproportionate amounts of work for extracting data of interest and frequently data are incomplete and of poor quality.

AimsSwissPedData aims to lay the foundation for a paediatric learning health system in Switzerland by facilitating EHR-based research. In this project, we aimed to assess the way routine clinical data are currently recorded in large paediatric clinics in Switzerland and to develop a national EHR-based common data model (CDM) that covers all processes of routine paediatric care in hospitals.

MethodsA taskforce of paediatricians from large Swiss childrens hospitals reviewed the current status of routine data documentation in paediatric clinical care and the extent of digitalization. We then used a modified Delphi method to reach a broad consensus on a national EHR-based CDM.

ResultsAll Swiss childrens hospitals use EHR to document some or all aspects of care. 119 paediatricians, representing eight hospitals and all paediatric subspecialties, participated in an extended Delphi process to create SwissPedData. The group agreed on a national CDM that comprises a main module with general paediatric data and sub-modules relevant to paediatric subspecialties. The data dictionary includes 336 common data elements (CDEs): 76 in the main module on general paediatrics and between 11 and 59 CDEs per subspecialty module. Among these, 266 were classified as mandatory, 52 as recommended and 18 as optional.

ConclusionSwissPedData is a CDM for information to be collected in EHR of Swiss childrens hospitals. It covers all care processes including clinical and paraclinical assessment, diagnosis, treatment, disposition and care site. All participating hospitals agreed to implement SwissPedData in their clinical routine and clinic information systems. This will pave the way for a national paediatric learning health system in Switzerland that enables fast and efficient answers to urgent clinical questions by facilitating high-quality nationwide retrospective and prospective observational studies and recruitment of patients for nested prospective studies and clinical trials.",NA,medrxiv

People with severe mental ill health (SMI - e.g., bipolar or psychosis spectrum disorders) are at greater risk for digital exclusion and it is unknown to what extent they are able to adapt to online service delivery. This cross-sectional survey study explored use of the Internet and digital devices during the pandemic restrictions and its association with physical and mental health changes.

Methods367 adults with an SMI diagnosis completed a survey (online or offline) and provided information on access to Internet connection and devices, internet skills, online activities, and barriers to using the Internet. They also self-reported changes in mental and physical health.

ResultsDuring the pandemic restrictions 61.6% were limited or non-users of the Internet. The majority had access to the Internet and digital devices but around half reported knowledge deficits. Most common activities were accessing information and entertainment (88.9%), staying in touch with friends and families (84.8%), and purchasing goods (other than food) (84.3%). Most common barriers were finding the Internet  not interesting (28.3%) or  too difficult (27.9%), as well as  security concerns (22.1% to 24.3%).

MethodsA qualitative design with focus group interviews was used to elaborate on the quantitative survey results obtained and analyzed in a previous survey study from the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five focus groups with seventeen adolescents were conducted digitally during the second pandemic phase in November and December 2020. The interview data were analyzed with directed content analysis.

ResultsThe adolescents reported using traditional media and official websites as sources for Covid-19 information. They engaged in preventive behavior, and washing hands and keeping a distance from strangers had become a habit. However, not being physically close to friends felt strange and unpleasant. The measure most frequently discussed was limiting social contact, which was a constant struggle. No one disputed the authorities guidelines and rules, but the social restrictions caused boredom and despair, particularly due to interrupted schooling and missed opportunities to engage in life events, and freely socialize with friends.

ConclusionThe adolescents gave an overall impression of being health literate, which corresponds well with the results from our previous survey study.

Malaria cases and deaths may increase due to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in malaria endemic countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

ObjectivesThis scoping review aims to summarize information on public health relevant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria situation in SSA.

MethodsReview of publications and manuscripts on preprint servers, in peer-reviewed journals and in grey literature documents from December 1, 2019, to June 9, 2021. A structured search was conducted on different databases using predefined eligibility criteria for the selection of articles.

ResultsA total of 51 papers have been included in the analysis. Modeling papers have predicted a significant increase in malaria cases and malaria deaths in SSA due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many papers provided potential explanations for expected COVID-19 effects on the malaria burden; these ranged from relevant diagnostic and clinical aspects, to reduced access to health care services, impaired availability of curative and preventive commodities and medications, and effects on malaria prevention campaigns. Compared to previous years, fewer country reports provided data on the actual number of malaria cases and deaths in 2020, with mixed results. While highly endemic countries reported evidence of decreased malaria cases in health facilities, low endemic countries reported an overall higher numbers of malaria cases and deaths in 2020.

ConclusionsThe findings from this review provide evidence for a significant but diverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in SSA. There is the need to further investigate the public health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the malaria burden.

To better understand teachers fear of infection and risk perception we conducted a survey in Germany.

MethodsParticipants were recruited through various associations and invited to take part in a cross-sectional COVID-19 specific online survey. Anonymous demographic and self-reported data were collected from those who gave their informed consent. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. To evaluate with fear associated factors of contracting SARS-CoV-2, an adjusted multivariable regression analysis was performed.

Results6.753 teachers gave their informed consent to answer the online survey. The median age of the teachers was 43 years with 77% being female. Most teachers worked in high schools (29%) and elementary schools (26%). Most participants (73%) feared to contract SARS-CoV-2 at school while 77% intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 98% considered students to pose the greatest risk. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that female and younger teachers were significantly more anxious to get infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that the odds teachers were more anxious was 9 times higher for those who favored re-opening of schools the least (p < 0.001).

ConclusionsTo the authors knowledge, this is the first study to describe teachers fear and risk perception of COVID-19 and their attitude towards vaccinations in a nationwide survey. The anxiety correlates to the COVID-19 protection measures demanded. Teachers fear is the driving factor and not a rational logic.",NA,medrxiv

Assessed resources were health professionals, hospital beds, and medical equipment. A synthetic indicator, Installed Capacity Index (ICI) was calculated using Principal Component Analysis.

ResultsThere was an increase in all selected indicators between January and December 2020. We observed differences between the Northeast, North regions, and the other regions of the country. Most Health Regions presented low ICI. The ICI increased especially in regions with considerably high baseline capacity in January 2020. The Northeast and North had a higher concentration oflow ICI regions.

ConclusionThe information here provided may be used by health authorities, providers, and managers in planning and adjusting for future Covid-19 care and in dimensioning the adequate supply of hospital beds, health care professionals, and devices in Health Regions to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.",NA,medrxiv

Therefore, we have designed this systematic review to estimate the pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in patients with MS. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients.

MethodWe searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, and gray literature including references from the identified studies, review studies, and conference abstracts which were published up to January 2021. Articles that were relevant to our topic and could provide information regarding the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, or the scores of smell threshold, discrimination, or identification (TDI scores) among MS patients and healthy individuals were included; however, articles published before 1990 and after the end of 2020 were excluded.

ResultsThe literature search found 1630 articles. After eliminating duplicates, 897 articles remained. two abstract conference papers were included for final analysis. A total of 1099 MS cases and 299 MS patients with olfactory dysfunction were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the included studies was 27.2%. (95% CI: [19.7%, 35.4%]) Also, the overall TDI score in MS patients was lower than that in the control group (SMD=-1.00; 95% CI: [-1.44, -0.56]), and the level of Threshold (SMD= -0.47; 95% CI: [-0.75, -0.19]), Discrimination (SMD=-0.53; 95% CI: [-0.96, -0.10]), and Identification (SMD=-1.02; 95% CI: [-1.36, -0.68]) per se were lower in MS compared with control respectively.

ConclusionThe results of this systematic review shows that the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients is high and more attention needs to be drawn to this aspect of MS.",NA,medrxiv

Here we present novel machine learning frameworks for identifying common and rare disease-associated genetic variation, which outperform conventional approaches. By integrating single-cell multiomics profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions, we have discovered and validated over 1,000 risk genes underlying severe COVID-19 across 19 cell types. Identified risk genes are overexpressed in healthy lungs but relatively downregulated in severely diseased lungs. Genetic risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants, is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness. Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE, enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are consistent across multiple populations and cohorts. Risk stratification based on exome sequencing has the potential to facilitate post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals, potentially based around augmentation of NK cell function.

Because access to PCR testing was limited during the first wave (February to June 2020) and regional data were reported with delay, adequate monitoring of community disease spread was hampered. The app-based COVID Symptom Study was launched in Sweden to disseminate real-time estimates of disease spread and to collect prospective data for research. The aim of this study was to describe the research project, develop models for estimation of COVID-19 prevalence and to evaluate it for prediction of hospital admissions for COVID-19.

MethodsWe enrolled 143 531 study participants ([&ge;]18 years) throughout Sweden, who contributed 10{middle dot}6 million daily symptom reports between April 29, 2020 and February 10, 2021. Data from 19 161 self-reported PCR tests were used to create a symptom-based algorithm to estimate daily prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19. The prediction model was validated using external datasets. We further utilized the model estimates to forecast subsequent new hospital admissions.

FindingsA prediction model for symptomatic COVID-19 based on 17 symptoms, age, and sex yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0{middle dot}78 (95% CI 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}83) in an external validation dataset of 943 PCR-tested symptomatic individuals. App-based surveillance proved particularly useful for predicting hospital trends in times of insufficient testing capacity and registration delays. During the first wave, our prediction model estimates demonstrated a lower mean error (0{middle dot}38 average new daily hospitalizations per 100 000 inhabitants per week (95% CI 0{middle dot}32, 0{middle dot}45)) for subsequent hospitalizations in the ten most populated counties, than a model based on confirmed case data (0{middle dot}72 (0{middle dot}64, 0{middle dot}81)). The model further correctly identified on average three out of five counties (95% CI 2{middle dot}3, 3{middle dot}7) with the highest rates of hospitalizations the following week during the first wave and four out of five (3{middle dot}0, 4{middle dot}6) during the second wave.

InterpretationThe experience of the COVID Symptom Study highlights the important role citizens can play in real-time monitoring of infectious diseases, and how app-based data collection may be used for data-driven rapid responses to public health challenges.

A fast diagnosis is crucial for patient management. Proteins that are synthesized during the inflammatory response can be used as biomarkers, helping in a rapid clinical assessment or an early diagnosis of infection. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers of inflammation for the diagnosis and prognosis of infection in patients with suspected sepsis.

MethodsIn total 406 episodes were included in a prospective cohort study. Plasma was collected from all patients on the first day of a new episode. Samples were analysed using a 92-plex proteomic panel based on a proximity extension assay with oligonucleotide-labelled antibody probe pairs (OLink, Uppsala, Sweden). Supervised and unsupervised differential expression analyses and pathway enrichment analyses were performed.

ResultsSupervised differential expression analysis revealed 21 proteins that were significantly lower in circulation of patients with viral infections compared to patients with bacterial infections. More strongly, higher expression levels were observed for 38 proteins in patients with high SOFA scores (>4), and for 21 proteins in patients with worse outcome. These proteins are mostly involved in pathways known to be activated early in the inflammatory response. Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering confirmed that inflammatory response was more strongly related to disease severity than to aetiology.

ConclusionSeveral differentially expressed inflammatory proteins were identified that could be used as biomarkers for sepsis. These proteins are mostly related to disease severity. Within the setting of an emergency department, they could be used for outcome prediction, patient monitoring, and directing diagnostics.

MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of two prospectively collected datasets. The population included was 92 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with Covid-19, and 240 patients who received IMV with non-Covid-19 illness before the pandemic. Follow-up data was collected post-hospital discharge using self-reported questionnaires. The main outcome measures were self-reported fatigue severity and the prevalence of severe fatigue (severity >7/10) 3 and 12-months post-hospital discharge.

ResultsCovid-19 IMV-patients were significantly younger with less prior comorbidity, and more males, than pre-pandemic IMV-patients. At 3-months, the prevalence (38.9% [7/18] vs. 27.1% [51/188]) and severity (median 5.5/10 vs. 5.0/10) of fatigue was similar between the Covid-19 and pre-pandemic populations respectively.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study in inpatient and outpatient care settings of Israels largest public healthcare provider (that covers 4.7 million members).

Participants included 1,173 members who had a diagnosis of opioid use disorder in the years between 2013 and 2018. Each patient was matched with 10 controls based on age and sex. The main outcome was monthly healthcare costs.

ResultsThe mean monthly healthcare cost of members with opioid use disorder was $1,102 compared to $211 among controls (5.2-fold difference; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6-6.0). After excluding members with heroin related diagnoses before the index date (in order to focus on prescription opioids), this healthcare cost ratio did not substantially change (4.6-fold; 95%-CI: 3.9-5.4). Members with opioid use disorder under the age of 65 years had a cost difference of 6.1-fold (95%-CI: 5.2-7.1), while those 65 years and older experienced cost difference of 3.4-fold (95%-CI: 2.6-4.5). The category with the highest cost for members with opioid use disorder was inpatient services, which was 8.7-fold (95%-CI 7.2-10.4) greater than among controls.

ConclusionsHealthcare costs among individuals with opioid use disorder in a public health system were substantially higher than among controls, at least partially attributed to prescription opioid use disorder.

To achieve this objective next-generation sequencing of miRNAs in plasma from bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS) - a gold standard in diagnosing ACTH-secreting PitNETs, was carried out.

MethodsSinistral (left) and dextral (right) BIPSS blood samples of the patient were collected in three time points: before the administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone, 5 and 15 minutes after stimulation. Peripheral venous blood samples were also collected 24 hours before and after BIPSS and before the resection of PitNET and 24 hours after. In differential expression analysis sinistral plasma was compared with dextral.

ResultsBIPSS concluded that the highest amount of ACTH was released in the sinistral side at the 5th minute mark indicating a presence of tumor. The highest amount of differentially expressed miRNAs was observed 5 minutes after stimulation (20 upregulated, 14 downregulated). At the 5th minute mark in sinistral plasma, two miRNAs were identified: hsa-miR-7-5p and hsa-miR-375-3p that were highly upregulated compared to other BIPSS samples and peripheral plasma samples.

Using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model we examine optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation decisions across two populations considering the impact of population size, underlying immunity, continuous vaccine roll-out, and heterogeneous population risk structure. We find that in the context of an emerging pathogen, where many epidemiologic characteristics might not be known, equal vaccine allocation between populations performs optimally in most scenarios.

However, few studies have accounted for the nature of contagious diseases, i.e., their dependent happenings.

AimWe aimed to quantify the impact of temperature on the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. We employed two epidemiological measurements of transmissibility and severity: the effective reproduction number (Rt) and case fatality risk (CFR).

MethodsWe used empirical surveillance data and meteorological data in Tokyo to estimate the Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR and to subsequently assess the nonlinear and delay effect of temperature on Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR.

ResultsFor Rt at low temperatures, the cumulative relative risk (RR) at first temperature percentile (3.3{degrees}C) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.7). As for the virulence to humans, moderate cold temperatures were associated with higher CFR, and CFR also increased as the temperature rose. The cumulative RR at the 10th and 99th percentiles of temperature (5.8{degrees}C and 30.8{degrees}C) for CFR were 3.5 (95%CI: 1.3-10) and 6.4 (95%CI: 4.1-10.1).

Azithromycin is a promising alternative to amoxicillin as it can be administered as a single dose and has efficacy against several pathogens involved in the burden of infectious disease and mortality in this population. In this pilot study, we aimed to establish the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial and to provide preliminary evidence comparing the effect of azithromycin to amoxicillin on weight gain in children with uncomplicated SAM.

MethodsThis pilot randomized trial enrolled children 6-59 months old with uncomplicated SAM at 6 healthcare centers in Burkina Faso. Participants were randomized to a single dose of azithromycin or a 7-day course of amoxicillin. All participants received ready-to-use therapeutic food and were followed weekly until nutritional recovery and again at 8 weeks. The primary feasibility outcomes included enrollment potential, refusals, and loss to follow-up. The primary clinical outcome was weight gain (g/kg/day) over the 8-week period. Outcome assessors were masked.

ResultsBetween June and October 2020, 312 children were screened, 301 were enrolled with 0 refusals, and 282 (93.6%) completed the 8-week visit. Average weight gain was 2.5 g/kg/day (SD 2.0) in the azithromycin group and 2.6 (SD) 1.7) in the amoxicillin group (Mean Difference - 0.1, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.3, P = 0.63). Fewer adverse events were reported in the azithromycin group (Risk Ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82, P = 0.006).

ConclusionsNo differences were found in weight gain between groups. Given the ability to administer a single dose and the potential for fewer adverse events, azithromycin may be an alternative to amoxicillin for uncomplicated SAM.

Here, we hypothesized that DBD kidneys may undergo proteolytic processes that renders grafts susceptible to post-transplant dysfunction.

Material & MethodsUsing mass spectrometry and immunoblotting analyses, we profiled degradation patterns of cytoskeletal proteins in deceased (n=55) and living (n=10) donor kidneys.

ResultsWe found that in DBD kidneys, key podocyte cytoskeletal proteins had been proteolytically cleaved. Generated degradation profiles were not associated to donor related demographic and clinical factors but were associated to suboptimal post-transplant function. Strikingly, -actinin -4 and Talin-1 degradation profiles were not observed in circulatory-death or living-donor kidneys. As Talin-1 is a specific proteolytic target of Calpain-1, we investigated a potential trigger of Calpain activation and Talin-1 degradation using ex-vivo precision-cut human kidney slices and in-vitro immortalised human podocytes. Notably, we found that Transforming-Growth Factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) activated Calpain-1 and proteolytically cleaved Talin-1 to generate distinct peptide fragments. These peptide fragments were of similar size and matched the degradation patterns observed in DBD kidneys. Talin-1 degradation was prevented in vitro by Calpain-1 inhibition.

ConclusionsHere, we provide initial evidence that DBD kidneys are susceptible to cytoskeletal protein degradation that impacts posttransplant kidney function. Subsequent studies should aim to further investigate the link between brain death and activation of proteolytic pathways exploring new therapeutic opportunities.",NA,medrxiv

The AN Care Pathway (ANCP) was introduced at our institution in 2016 to improve quality of care of patients admitted for medical observation and management. We report results from our review of medical complications and report the impact and adoption of the ANCP.

MethodsThe ANCP was developed in response to a need to improve quality of medical monitoring of patients with severe AN using Squire Guidelines and the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. All patients admitted to a medical hospital with AN between 2010-2020 were included after hospital inpatient enquiry and medical records were reviewed. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Stata (Statcorp).

ResultsFifty-one patients (63 admissions) were included. Median BMI was 13.8 kg/m (11.9-22.5). After ANCP implementation in 2016, compliance with recommended daily ECG, thiamine and blood tests improved from 30% (n=8/27) to 86% (n=21/36). We report a high rate of medical complications of severe AN including anaemia (n=24, 47%), neutropoenia (n=18, 35%), abnormal liver bloods (n=15, 29%) and half developed refeeding syndrome. One-third patients had cardiovascular compromise including reduced cardiac contractility (n=13, 25%), pericardial effusion (n=7, 14%) and one death. Low BMI was associated with cardiovascular complications (mean BMI 13.5 kg/m vs 15.5 kg/m, p=0.01) and neutropoenia (mean BMI 13.4 kg/m vs 15.4 kg/m, p=0.02).

ConclusionIntroduction of the ANCP improved quality of care during medical stabilisation. We report a high rate of medical complications of severe AN in patients admitted to a medical hospital. Use of multidisciplinary care protocols may contribute to quality improvement and improved consistency of care for this vulnerable population.",NA,medrxiv

In the current context of multipurpose prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases /HIV development, it is critical to have a better understanding of acceptability of and satisfaction with the contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR), including sexual satisfaction. The objective of this study was to review the evidence about CVRs acceptability, and users general and sexual satisfaction.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science (until December 31th, 2020) and selected original studies documenting actual use of hormonal CVR and explicitly addressing any of the three outcomes.

Main ResultsOf a total of 1129 records screened, 46 studies were included. Most studies (n=43, 93%) were prospective, conducted in high-income settings (n=35) and reported on NuvaRing(R) use (n=31). Overall, 27 (59%) studies included a comparison group, 38 (82%) used exclusively quantitative questionnaires, with qualitative only (n=4, 9%) or mixed methods (n=4, 9%) studies being less common. Ease of CVR insertion/removal/reinsertion was high in all setting and improved with time of use, with qualitative studies supporting these findings. When reported, results on continuation of use were mixed and ring-related events were associated with discontinuation. Among NuvaRing(R) studies, general satisfaction (being satisfied or very satisfied) was between 80 and 90% and tended to mirror continuation. Sexual satisfaction was less commonly reported and results were mixed. Overall, limited information was provided on actual CVR experiences of women (and men) and cultural norms that may affect sexuality and CVR use.

ConclusionPositive aspects of acceptability of and satisfaction with CVRs were reported but continuation rates and ring-related events deserve further study. More information is needed on actual experiences of women using CVRs, relationship aspects, male partner opinions, and contextual norms to better understand the acceptability of and satisfaction with CVRs.

Key strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis review brings an historical and international perspective on acceptability and satisfaction of contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR), since the 1970s in high, middle and low income countries.
C_LIO_LIAn holistic approach was used, including original studies documenting actual use of hormonal CVR and explicitly addressing acceptability, general and sexual satisfaction.
C_LIO_LIOur results may inform the development and promotion approaches for CVR and more broadly vaginal rings that could provide combined prevention of HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.
C_LIO_LIGiven the lack of standardized definitions of acceptability and satisfaction, articles documenting CVR acceptability or satisfaction that were not explicitly using this terminology and instead referred to continuation or adherence may have been missed.

Despite a successful vaccine rollout during the first half of 2021, cases and hospitalisations have started to increase since the end of May as the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant increases in frequency. The final step of relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in England has been delayed from 21 June to 19 July 2021.

MethodsThe REal-time Assessment of Community Transmision-1 (REACT-1) study measures the prevalence of swab-positivity among random samples of the population of England. Round 12 of REACT-1 obtained self-administered swab collections from participants from 20 May 2021 to 7 June 2021; results are compared with those for round 11, in which swabs were collected from 15 April to 3 May 2021.

ResultsBetween rounds 11 and 12, national prevalence increased from 0.10% (0.08%, 0.13%) to 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). During round 12, we detected exponential growth with a doubling time of 11 (7.1, 23) days and an R number of 1.44 (1.20, 1.73). The highest prevalence was found in the North West at 0.26% (0.16%, 0.41%) compared to 0.05% (0.02%, 0.12%) in the South West. In the North West, the locations of positive samples suggested a cluster in Greater Manchester and the east Lancashire area. Prevalence in those aged 5-49 was 2.5 times higher at 0.20% (0.16%, 0.26%) compared with those aged 50 years and above at 0.08% (0.06%, 0.11%). At the beginning of February 2021, the link between infection rates and hospitalisations and deaths started to weaken, although in late April 2021, infection rates and hospital admissions started to reconverge. When split by age, the weakened link between infection rates and hospitalisations at ages 65 years and above was maintained, while the trends converged below the age of 65 years. The majority of the infections in the younger group occurred in the unvaccinated population or those without a stated vaccine history. We observed the rapid replacement of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 with the Delta variant during the period covered by rounds 11 and 12 of the study.

DiscussionThe extent to which exponential growth continues, or slows down as a consequence of the continued rapid roll-out of the vaccination programme, including to young adults, requires close monitoring. Data on community prevalence are vital to track the course of the epidemic and inform ongoing decisions about the timing of further lifting of restrictions in England.",NA,medrxiv

It is unclear how rare and common variation contribute to QT interval duration in the general population.

ObjectivesInvestigate monogenic and polygenic contributions to QT interval duration and the role of polygenic variation in modulating phenotypic expression of rare monogenic variation.

MethodsWe performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of QTc duration in 44,979 United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB) participants and created a polygenic risk score (PRS). The PRS was validated in 39,800 independent UKBB participants. Among 26,976 participants with whole genome sequencing and ECG data in the TransOmics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, we identified 160 carriers of putative pathogenic rare variants in 10 LQTS genes. We examined QTc associations with the PRS and with LQTS rare variants in TOPMed.

ResultsTwenty independent loci (4 novel) were identified by GWAS. The PRS comprising 565 common variants was significantly associated with QTc duration in TOPMed (p=1.1x10-64). Carriers of LQTS rare variants had longer QTc intervals than non-carriers ({Delta}QTc=10.9 ms [7.4-14.4] for all LQTS genes; {Delta}QTc=26.5 ms [20.7-32.3] for KCNQ1, KCNH2 and SCN5A). 16.7% of individuals with QTc>480 ms carried either a rare variant in a LQTS gene or had a PRS in the top decile (3.4% monogenic, 13.6% top decile of PRS). We observed a greater effect of rare variants on the QTc among individuals with a higher polygenic risk (lowest PRS tertile:{Delta}QTccarrier/non-carrier=4.8 ms [-1.2-10.7];highest PRS tertile:{Delta}QTccarrier/non-carrier=18.9 ms [12.8-25.1];p-interaction=0.001).

ConclusionsQTc duration is influenced by both rare variants in established LQTS genes and polygenic risk. The phenotypic expression of monogenic variation is modulated by polygenic variation. Nevertheless, over 80% of individuals with prolonged QTc do not carry a rare monogenic variant or polygenic risk equivalent.

Condensed AbstractThe QT interval duration is a well-established marker of sudden cardiac death. We examined the joint contribution of monogenic and polygenic variation to QT interval duration. Among individuals with pronounced QTc prolongation (>480 ms), 1 in 6 carried either a monogenic rare variant in a LQTS gene or had a PRS in the top decile, and over 80% had no identified genetic risk. Additionally, we found that polygenic risk modulates the phenotypic expression of putative pathogenic rare variants in LQTS genes, with a greater effect of rare variants on the QTc observed among individuals with a greater polygenic risk.",NA,medrxiv

By enhancing infectivity and evading immunity, infection with these variants might result in more severe clinical outcomes as well as being more resistant to vaccines developed on the basis of the original prototypic virus variant. One such example is the alpha variant (B.1.1.7), which has been detected in more than 100 countries and rapidly become the dominant strain in the UK in late 2020 and early 2021. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate surveillance programmes to rapidly monitor the spread of variants and to better understand the role of variants in disease outcomes and immune evasion. The nucleotide sequencing method, the  gold standard of variant detection, is unsuitable as a fast-response surveillance tool by frontline diagnostic services which require detection methods with short turnaround times. We developed a screening protocol based of sequential allele-specific qPCR for detection of the N501Y mutation and H69/V70 deletion present in the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant. We tested this protocol in previously confirmed positive samples from the Pathology Dept, University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire during the second wave period in the UK (December 2020-March 2021). In these samples variant identity was confirmed by NGS sequencing via COG-UK. Our results identified increased incidence of variants containing both N501Y and {Delta}69/70 HV mutations, especially in patients admitted during January and early February 2021. This approach, which yields results within 3 hours, can be used as an initial rapid screening step with NGS as confirmatory follow-up. We also report that the increased prevalence of alpha/B.1.1.7 variant in admitted patients since mid-January 2021, a period that characterised peaked mortality rates, was associated with a sharp 2.5-fold rise in the mean circulating IL-6 level and to a lesser extent Troponin-T. More detailed biomarker analysis of a small cohort of patients (n=83), where variant status and clinical outcomes were available, demonstrated that deceased patients infected with the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant had significantly higher levels of inflammation and cell injury markers, especially IL-6 and LDH, compared to deceased patients infected with a non-alpha/B.1.1.7 variant, pointing towards a more severe inflammatory disease phenotype.

Children may possess an immunity that adults lack, possibly from childhood vaccinations. This retrospective study suggests immunization against the poliovirus may provide an immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsPublicly available data were analyzed for possible correlations between national median ages and epidemiological outbreak patterns across 100 countries. Sera from 204 adults and children, who were immunized with the poliovirus vaccine, were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of polio-immune serum on SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathology in cell culture were then evaluated.

ResultsAnalyses of median population age demonstrated a positive correlation between median age and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and death rates. Countries with effective poliovirus immunization protocols and younger populations have fewer and less pathogenic cases of COVID-19. Antibodies to poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were found in pediatric sera and in sera from adults recently immunized with polio. Western blot demonstrated antibodies recognized the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) of either virus. Sera from polio-immunized individuals inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cell cultures. These results suggest the anti-D3-pol-antibody, induced by poliovirus vaccination, may provide a similar degree of protection from SARS-CoV-2 to adults as to children.

ConclusionsPoliovirus vaccination induces an adaptive humoral immune response. Antibodies created by poliovirus vaccination bind the RdRp protein of both poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings suggest proteins other than ""spike"" proteins may be suitable targets for immunity and vaccine development.",NA,medrxiv

Early data did not report an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease severity in pregnancy. However, surveillance data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates a higher risk of severe disease and death in pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, although this data is subject to ascertainment bias.

ObjectiveTo explore the association between COVID-19 disease severity and pregnancy in our university-based hospital system using measures such as COVID-19 ordinal scale severity score, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, oxygen supplementation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death.

Study designWe conducted a retrospective, multicenter case-control study to understand the association between COVID-19 disease severity and pregnancy. We reviewed consecutive charts of adult females, ages 18-45, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in six months between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Cases were patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy, whereas controls were not pregnant at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Primary endpoints were the COVID-19 severity score at presentation (within four hours) and the nadir of the clinical course. The secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, oxygen supplementation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death.

ResultsA higher proportion of pregnant women had moderate to severe COVID-19 disease at the nadir of the clinical course than nonpregnant women (25% vs. 16.1%, p=0.04, respectively). While there was a higher rate of hospitalization (25.6% vs. 17.2%), ICU admission (8.9% vs. 4.4%), need for vasoactive substances (5.0% vs. 2.8%), and invasive mechanical ventilation (5.6% vs. 2.8%) in the pregnant group, this difference was not significant after the propensity score matching was applied.

We found a high rate of pregnancy complications in our population (40.7%). The most worrisome is the rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (20.1%).

ConclusionsIn our propensity score-matched study, COVID-19 in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of disease severity and an increased risk of pregnancy complications.",NA,medrxiv

A systemic hyper-inflammation characterizes the severe COVID-19 disease often associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Blood biomarkers capable of risk stratification are of great importance in effective triage and critical care of severe COVID-19 patients. In the present study we report higher plasma abundance of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (sUPAR), expressed by an abnormally expanded circulating myeloid cell population, in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Plasma sUPAR level was found to be linked to a characteristic proteomic signature of plasma, linked to coagulation disorders and complement activation. Receiver operator characteristics curve analysis identified a cut-off value of sUPAR at 1996.809 pg/ml that could predict survival in our cohort (Odds ratio: 2.9286, 95% confidence interval 1.0427-8.2257).

In this scenario, a support during pronation by the ICU Physiotherapy Team was introduced.

Research methodologyRetrospective analysis. Consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients.

SettingA COVID-19 Center in southern Switzerland, between March 16th and April 30th, 2020.

Main Outcome MeasuresRates and characteristics of pronation-related complications.

ResultsForty-two patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) were treated; 296 standard prone/supine positioning were performed, with 3.52 cycles/patient. One (0.3%) major complication was observed, while fourteen (33.3%) patients developed minor complications, e.g. pressure injuries. The incidence of pressure sores was related to ICU length-of-stay (LOS) (p = 0.029) and MV days (p = 0.015), while their number (n = 27) further correlated with ICU LOS (p = 0.001) and MV days (p = 0.001). The propensity matching score analysis did not show any protective factor of pronation regarding pressure injuries (p = 0.448). No other significant correlation was found.

ConclusionThe specific pronation team determined a low rate of major complications in critically ill COVID19 patients. The high rate of minor complications appeared to be related to disease severity, rather than from pronation.",NA,medrxiv

Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) are used to detect latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection (LTBI) in adults, but their performance in the elderly is not well-established. We aim to evaluate the performance of IGRAs for LTBI detection in healthy elderly Hispanics with recent, remote or no history of M.tb exposure.

Study Design and MethodsCross-sectional study in Hispanic elderly (60+y) and adult (18-50y) recent TB contacts (ReC) or community controls (CoC). LTBI was based on a positive T-SPOT.TB and/or QuantiFERON-Gold in-tube or -Plus assay.

ResultsWe enrolled 193 CoC (119 adults/74 elderly) and 459 ReC (361 adults/98 elderly). LTBI positivity increased with age in CoC (range 19-59%; trend p <0.001), but was similar in ReC (range 59-69%; trend p=0.329). The elderly had lower concordance between IGRAs (kappa 0.465 vs. 0.688 in adults) and more inconclusive results (indeterminate/borderline; 11.6% vs. 5.8% in adults; p=0.012). Exclusion of inconclusive results improved concordance between assays, notably in elderly ReC, who have the highest TB risk (from kappa 0.532 to 0.800). When both IGRAs were done simultaneously, inconclusive results were resolved in all cases as positive or negative with the other IGRA. The magnitude of the response to M.tb peptides used in the assays was similar between age groups, but responsiveness to mitogens was lower in the elderly.

ConclusionsIGRAs are suitable for LTBI detection in the elderly. Discordant and inconclusive findings are more prevalent in the elderly, but results were resolved when performing different IGRAs simultaneously in the same participant.",NA,medrxiv

Of note, T cells from individuals who recovered after SARS-CoV-2 re-infection spontaneously produced elevated levels of IL-5 and secreted the immunosuppressive TH2 cytokine interleukin-10 in response to SARS-CoV-2 lysate, suggesting that TH2 responses to SARS-CoV-2 are inadequate. Moreover, individuals susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited a deficit in the TH1 peptide repertoire affecting the highly mutated receptor binding domain (RBD) amino acids (331-525) of the spike protein. Finally, current vaccines successfully triggered anti-RBD specific TH1 responses in 88% healthy subjects that were negative prior to immunization. These findings indicate that COVID-19 protection relies on TH1 cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD which in turn likely drives the phylogenetic escape of the virus. The next generation of COVID-19 vaccines should elicit high-avidity TH1 (rather than TH2)-like T cell responses against the RBD domain of current and emerging viral variants.",NA,medrxiv

Inter-relationships between sleep and mental health have not been examined using longitudinal objective sleep-wake data, during these abruptly imposed lifestyle changes.

We examined objective sleep-wake data and surveyed mental health data collected among 4,912 U.S. adult users of a validated sleep wearable (WHOOP, Boston, Massachusetts) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparing the pre-pandemic (January 1 to March 12, 2020) and acute pandemic-onset intervals (March 13 to April 12, 2020), participants exhibited increased mean sleep duration (0.25h [95% CI = 0.237-0.270]), later sleep onset (18m [17.378-20.045]) and offset (36m [35.111-38.106]), and increased consistency of sleep timing (3.51 [3.295-3.728] out of 100); all P < 0.0001. Generally, participants with persistent sleep deficiency and low sleep consistency had higher odds of symptoms of anxiety or depression, burnout, and new or increased substance use during the pandemic. Decreases in sleep duration (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.65, P = 0.025) and sleep consistency (2.05 [1.17-3.67], P = 0.009) were associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We suggest that sleep duration and consistency may be important predictors of risk of adverse mental health outcomes during a pandemic.

This model can effectively avoid the prediction malfunction by using the traditional ordinary differential equation methods such as SIR (susceptible, infectious and recovered) model and so on. Meanwhile, it would forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hot spots geographically at different time. According to the results revealed by Bayesian model, the effect of population geographical distribution should be considered in the prediction of epidemic situation, and there is no simple derivation relationship between the threshold of group immunity and the virus reproduction number R0.

Behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal structure wherein epidemiological variables integrate the effects of diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to forecast mutations that will spread in the future, and characterize how these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies.

Previously, we have shown that treatment with proxalutamide, a non-steroidal androgen receptor antagonist, accelerates viral clearance and clinical remission in outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to placebo. The effects in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were unknown.

MethodsMen and women hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 300 mg of proxalutamide per day or placebo for 14 days. The study was conducted at eight sites in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The primary outcome measure was the clinical status (8-point ordinal scale) at 14-days post-randomization. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 14-day recovery ratio (alive hospital discharge [scores 1, 2]).

FindingsA total of 645 patients were randomized (317 received proxalutamide, 328 placebo) and underwent intention-to-treat analysis. The 14-day median ordinal scale score in the proxalutamide group was 1 (interquartile range [IQR]=1-2) versus 7 (IQR=2-8) for placebo, P<0.001.

METHODSWe evaluated four immunomodulatory agents in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult participants with COVID-19 were randomized to receive tocilizumab, sarilumab, anakinra, or standard care (control). In addition, a small group (n=21) of participants were randomized to interferon-{beta}1a. The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial used a Bayesian statistical model with pre-defined triggers for superiority, equivalence or futility.

RESULTSStatistical triggers for equivalence between tocilizumab and sarilumab; and for inferiority of anakinra to the other active interventions were met at a planned adaptive analysis. Of the 2274 critically ill participants enrolled, 972 were assigned to tocilizumab, 485 to sarilumab, 378 to anakinra and 418 to control.

The results of an NMA depend critically on the quality of evidence being pooled. In assessing the validity of an NMA, it is therefore important to know the proportion contributions of each direct treatment comparison to each network treatment effect. The construction of proportion contributions is based on the observation that each row of the hat matrix represents a so-called  evidence flow network for each treatment comparison. However, the existing algorithm used to calculate these values is associated with ambiguity according to the selection of paths. In this work we present a novel analogy between NMA and random walks. We use this analogy to derive closed-form expressions for the proportion contributions. A random walk on a graph is a stochastic process that describes a succession of random  hops between vertices which are connected by an edge. The weight of an edge relates to the probability that the walker moves along that edge. We use the graph representation of NMA to construct the transition matrix for a random walk on the network of evidence. We show that the net number of times a walker crosses each edge of the network is related to the evidence flow network. By then defining a random walk on the directed evidence flow network, we derive analytically the matrix of proportion contributions. The random-walk approach, in addition to being computationally more efficient, has none of the associated ambiguity of the existing algorithm.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed to examine the key risk factors to better understand transmission in school settings.

MethodsWe collected records of SARS-CoV-2 school outbreaks globally published from January 2020 to January 2021 and compiled information on hypothesized risk factors. We utilized the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to conceptualize the risk mechanisms, used logistic regression to examine each risk-factor group, and further built multiple variable models based on the marginal analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

ResultsFrom 17 relevant articles, 26 school clusters were included for analysis. The best-fit model showed that the intensity of community transmission (aOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.22 - 1.30, for each increase of 10 cases per 100,000 persons per week), social distancing (aOR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.37), mask-wearing (aOR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.78) were associated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools. Compared to students in pre-schools, the aOR was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.07 - 0.19) for students in primary schools and 1.31 (95% CI: 0.93 - 1.87) for students in high schools.

ConclusionsPreventive measures in both schools (e.g. social distancing and mask-wearing) and communities (additionally, vaccination) should be taken to collectively reduce transmission and protect children in schools. Flexible reopening policies may be considered for different levels of schools given their risk differences.

Incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 case rates have demonstrated extreme geospatial and temporal variability across the globe. The outbreaks in some countries are extreme and devastating, while other countries face outbreaks that are relatively minor. The causes of these differences between nations remain poorly understood, and identifying the factors that underlie this variation is critical to understand the dynamics of this disease in order to better respond to this and future pandemics.

Here, we examine four factors that we anticipated would explain much of the variation in COVID-19 rates between nations: median age, obesity rate, island status, and strength of border closure measures. Clinical evidence suggests that age and obesity increase both the likelihood of infection and transmission in individual patients, which make them plausible demographic factors. The third factor, whether or not each country is an island nation, was selected because the geographical isolation of islands is expected to influence COVID-19 transmission. The fourth factor of border closure was selected because of its anticipated interaction with island nation status.

Together, these four variables are able to explain a majority of the international variance in COVID-19 case rates. Using a dataset of 190 countries, simple modeling based on these four factors and their interactions explains more than 70% of the total variance between countries. With additional covariates, more complex modeling and higher-order interactions explains more than 80% of the variance. These novel findings offer a solution to explain the unusual global variation of COVID-19 that has remained largely elusive throughout the pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

Inadequately managed procedural pain can cause negative short-term and long-term implications for children, ranging from anxiety to aversion to healthcare. Parents have repeatedly expressed that they do not have the necessary tools to comfort or distract their child during uncomfortable medical procedures. As such, the purpose of this study was to work with parents to develop and evaluate two digital tools for pediatric procedural pain.

A whiteboard animation video and interactive infographic were developed following a systematic review and interview with parents. Prototypes were tested in five ED waiting rooms in two Canadian provinces. Sites included those in urban, rural, and remote settings. Overall, parents rated the tools highly, suggesting that engaging with parents to develop arts-based digital tools is a highly effective method in ensuring that parents can understand and utilize complex health information.

AimsTo examine how changes in four social factors contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over time and how these factors in turn interact with adversities and worries about adversities to increase risk for these outcomes.

MethodData from 49,227 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 59 weeks of the pandemic. Fixed effects logistic regressions examined time-varying associations between social support quality, loneliness, number of days of face-to-face contact for [&ge;]15 minutes, and number of days phoning/video calling for [&ge;]15 minutes with self-harm thoughts and behaviours. We then examined how these four factors in turn interacted with the total number of adversities and worries about adversity on outcomes.

ResultsIncreases in the quality of social support decreased the likelihood of both outcomes, whilst greater loneliness increased their likelihood. Associations were inconsistent for telephone/video contact and face-to-face contact with outcomes. Social support buffered and loneliness exacerbated the impact of adversity experiences with self-harm behaviours. Other interactions were inconsistent, and some were in the unexpected direction.

We used a dynamic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated (SEIRV) model, and simulated for potential vaccine strategies under a range of epidemic conditions. The predictions were based on different vaccination coverages (5% to 90%), vaccination-rates (1%, 2%, 5%) and vaccine-efficacies (40%, 60%, 80%) under different R0 (2,4,6). We observed how the above dynamics influenced the SEIRV model without COVID-19 vaccination at different R0 values, and estimated the duration, exposed and infected populations. When the R0 was increased, the days of reduction of susceptibility and the days to reach the peak of the infection were reduced gradually. At least 45% vaccine coverage is required for reducing the infected population as early as possible. The results revealed that when R0 is increased in the SEIRV model along with the increase of vaccination efficacy and vaccination rate, the population to be vaccinated is reducing. Thus, the vaccination offers greater benefits to the local population by reducing the time to reach the peak, exposed and infected population through flattening the curves.",NA,medrxiv

The objective of this study is to examine and quantify the association between overcrowded and multigenerational households, and COVID-19 in New York City (NYC).

MethodsWe conducted a Bayesian ecological time series analysis at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level in NYC to assess whether ZCTAs with higher proportions of overcrowded (defined as proportion of estimated number of housing units with more than one occupant per room) and multigenerational households (defined as the estimated percentage of residences occupied by a grandparent and a grandchild less than 18 years of age) were independently associated with higher suspected COVID-19 case rates (from NYC Department of Health Syndromic Surveillance data for March 1 to 30, 2020). Our main measure was adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of suspected COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. Our final model controlled for ZCTA-level sociodemographic factors (median income, poverty status, White race, essential workers), prevalence of clinical conditions related to COVID-19 severity (obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, asthma, smoking status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and spatial clustering.

Results39,923 suspected COVID-19 cases presented to emergency departments across 173 ZCTAs in NYC. Adjusted COVID-19 case rates increased by 67% (IRR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.52) in ZCTAs in quartile four (versus one) for percent overcrowdedness and increased by 77% (IRR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.79) in quartile four (versus one) for percent living in multigenerational housing. Interaction between both exposures was not significant ({beta}interaction = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00).

ConclusionsOver-crowdedness and multigenerational housing are independent risk factors for suspected COVID-19.

In addition, they were given seperate questionnaire as STOP BANG, Insomnia Severity Index Score, RLS questionnaire. Those persons with STOP BANG > 5, were also advised for a Polysomnography (PSG), if not already done. Descriptive statistical analysis has been carried out in the present study.

ResultsThe present study is a cross-sectional depiction of relationships between various respiratory diseases and sleep problems. As per this study, most patients were asthmatic and commonest sleep problem was OSA. A subgroup analysis was done to determine the significance of difference of various parameters between the three groups of asthmatic patients, patients having COPD and the  Other group.

DiscussionSubjective sleep problems were significantly more in Asthma group than COPD group (p<0.0362). The mean STOP BANG was more in COPD group than the Asthma group (p<0.0301). Though OSA was the commonest sleep problem between the three groups, but the prevalence was not statistically significant between them. More patients in the COPD group had insomnia, but it was not statistically significantly more than in Asthma group. Sleeping pill use was significantly more in COPD group than the Asthma group (p<0.0039).

ConclusionSleep problems are common in patients with respiratory diseases and OSA is the most common problem according to the present study. Asthma patients had more subjective sleep problems. Sleeping pill use is more common in COPD patients instead of having less subjective sleep complaints than asthma patients.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsPatients older than 15 years and followed at least for 6 months with one motor scale (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, HFMSE; Revised Upper Limb module, RULM) in five referral centers were included. Clinical and patients global impression of change (CGI-C and PGI-C) were recorded in treated patients at the last visit. Functional scales (Egen Klassification, EK2; Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale, ALSFRS-R) and the percent-predicted forced vital capacity were collected when available.

ResultsSeventy-nine SMA patients (39 treated with nusinersen) were included. Compared with untreated patients, treated patients showed a significant improvement of 2 points ({+/-}0.46) in RULM (p<0.001) after six months. After a mean follow-up of 16 months, nusinersen treatment was associated with a significant improvement in HFMSE (OR=1.15, p=0.006), 6MWT (OR=1.07, p<0.001), and EK2 (OR=0.81, p=0.001).

Compared with untreated patients, more treated patients experienced clinically meaningful improvements in all scales, but these differences were statistically significant only for RULM (p=0.033), ALSFRS-R (p=0.005), and EK2 (p<0.001). According to the CGI-C and PGI-C, 64.1% and 61.5% of treated patients improved with treatment. Being non-sitter was associated with less response to treatment, while longer time of treatment was associated with better response. Most treated patients (77%) presented at least one adverse event, mostly mild.

ConclusionsNusinersen treatment associates to some improvements in adult SMA patients. Most severely affected patients with complex spines are probably those with the most unfavorable risk-benefit ratio.",NA,medrxiv

It arises during the first two years of a childs life and is associated with developmental deficiencies and life-long health problems. Current interventions provide some benefit, but new approaches to prevention and treatment grounded in a molecular understanding of stunting are needed. Epigenetic analyses are critical as they can provide insight into how signals from a poor environment lead to changes in cell function.

ResultsHere we profiled histone H3 acetylation on lysine 27 (H3K27ac) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 18-week-old and one-year-old children living in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We show that 18-week-old children destined to become stunted have elevated levels of H3K27ac overall, functional analysis of which indicates activation of the immune system and stress response pathways as a primary response to a poor environment with high pathogen load. Conversely, overt stunting at 1-year-of age is associated with globally reduced H3K27ac that is indicative of metabolic rewiring and downregulation of the immune system and DNA repair pathways that are likely secondary responses to chronic exposure to a poor environment with limited nutrients. The results from one-year-old children also point toward deficiency in one-carbon metabolism, which is further supported by integrative analysis with results from histone H3 trimethylation on lysine 4 (H3K4me3).

ConclusionsThe epigenomes of stunted children undergo two global changes in H3K27ac within their first year of life, which are associated with probable initial hyperactive immune responses followed by reduced metabolic capacity. Limitation of one-carbon metabolites may play a key role in the development of stunting. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01375647.

MethodsHSUVs were elicited for seven health states (five THSs and two CHSs) depicting the symptoms of chlamydia, developed using evidence from the literature and clinical experts. The chained time trade-off (TTO) and visual analogue scale (VAS) were applied to THSs while conventional TTO was applied to the CHSs. Ectopic pregnancy was used as the anchor for the chained TTO approach. The study sampled from three different population groups and the survey was administered face-to-face.

ResultsOne hundred participants were assessed with an interview completion rate of 100%. Mean TTO utilities were consistently higher than VAS scores. The aggregated mean chained TTO results for the THS ranged from 0.46 (SD, 0.24) for ectopic pregnancy, to 0.77 (SD 0.21) for cervicitis.

Due to the aging of the world population, the prevalence of such diseases is therefore expected to starkly increase in the coming decades. While numerous biological age predictors have been developed to assess musculoskeletal aging, it remains unclear whether these different approaches and data capture a single aging process, or if the diverse joints and bones in the body age at different rates. In the following, we leverage 42,000 full body, spine, hip and knee X-ray images and musculoskeletal biomarkers from the UK Biobank and use artificial intelligence to build the most accurate musculoskeletal aging predictor to date (RMSE=2.65{+/-}0.01 years; R-Squared=87.6{+/-}0.1%). Our predictor is composite and can be used to assess spine age, hip age and knee age, in addition to general musculoskeletal aging. We find that accelerated musculoskeletal aging is moderately correlated between these different musculoskeletal dimensions (e.g hip vs. knee: Pearson correlation=.351{+/-}.004). Musculoskeletal aging is heritable at more than 35%, and the genetic factors are partially shared between joints (e.g hip vs. knee: genetic correlation=.52{+/-}.04). We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with accelerated musculoskeletal aging in approximately ten genes for each musculoskeletal dimension. General musculoskeletal aging is for example associated with a TBX15 variant linked to Cousin syndrome and acromegaloid facial appearance syndrome. Finally, we identified biomarkers, clinical phenotypes, diseases, environmental and socioeconomic variables associated with accelerated musculoskeletal aging in each dimension. We conclude that, while the aging of the different components of the musculoskeletal system is connected, each bone and joint can age at significantly different rates.",NA,medrxiv

We sought to identify whether there are distinct Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score trajectory-based subphenotypes in sepsis.

MethodsWe created 72-hour SOFA score trajectories in patients with sepsis from two diverse intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. We then used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compute patient similarities to capture evolving heterogeneous sequences and establish similarities between groups with distinct trajectories. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) was utilized to identify subphenotypes based on SOFA trajectory similarities. Patient characteristics were compared between subphenotypes and a random forest model was developed to predict subphenotype membership, within 6 hours of ICU arrival. The model was then tested on the validation cohort.

ResultsA total of 4,678 and 3,665 unique sepsis patients were included in development and validation cohorts. In the development cohort, four subphenotypes of organ dysfunction were identified: Rapidly Worsening (n=612, 13.08%), Delayed Worsening (n=960, 20.52%), Rapidly Improving (n=1,932, 41.3%) and Delayed Improving (n=1174, 25.1%). In-hospital mortality for patients within different subphenotypes demonstrated distinct patterns over time. Similar subphenotypes and their associated outcome patterns were replicated in the multicenter validation cohort.

ConclusionFour novel, clinically-defined, trajectory-based sepsis subphenotypes were identified and validated. Trajectory based subphenotyping is useful for describing the natural history of sepsis in the ICU. Understanding the pathophysiology of these differential trajectories may reveal unanticipated therapeutic targets for patients with sepsis and identify more precise populations and endpoints for the predictive enrichment of clinical trials.",NA,medrxiv

With limited resources, a proactive, targeted effort is needed to reach widespread community immunity.

ObjectiveIdentify county-level barriers to achieving rapid COVID-19 vaccine coverage and validate the index against vaccine rollout data.

DesignEcological study

SettingPopulation-based

ParticipantsLongitudinal COVID-19 vaccination coverage data for 50 states and the District of Columbia and 3118 counties from January 12 through May 25, 2021.

Exposure(s)The COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage index (CVAC) ranks states and counties on barriers to coverage through 28 indicators across 5 themes: historic undervaccination, sociodemographic barriers, resource-constrained health system, healthcare accessibility barriers, and irregular care-seeking behaviors. A score of 0 indicates the lowest level of concern, whereas a score of 1 indicates the highest level of concern.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)State-level vaccine administrations from January 12 through May 25, 2021, provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Our World In Data. County-level vaccine coverage as of May 25, 2021, provided by the CDC.

ResultsAs of May 25, 2021, the CVAC strongly correlated with the percentage of population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by county (r = -0.39, p=2.2x10-16) and state (r=-0.77, p=4.9x10-11). Low-concern states and counties have fully vaccinated 26.5% [t=6.8, p=1.7x10-7] and 26% (t=22.0, p=2.2x10-16) more people, respectively, compared to their high-concern counterparts. This vaccination gap is at its highest point since the start of vaccination and continues to grow. Higher concern on each of the five themes predicts a lower rate of vaccination at the county level (all p<.001). We identify five types of counties with distinct barrier profiles.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe CVAC measures underlying barriers to vaccination and is strongly associated with the speed of rollout. As the coverage gap between high- and low-concern regions continues to grow, the CVAC can inform a precision public health response targeted to underlying barriers.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich U.S. counties face barriers to COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and are these communities vaccinating fewer individuals?

FindingsThe COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC) comprises five themes reflecting county-level concern for low coverage. We report rural, regional, and racial divides in exposure to these vaccination barriers. The top third of states and counties of highest concern have vaccinated 19% and 20% fewer people, respectively, compared to regions of least concern.

MethodologyA 25 items tool was developed based on an analytical construct for ability estimation through Rasch Analysis (RA). RA models the probability of right/wrong answer as a function of person(participants) and item (questions) parameters and calculates the item difficulty in relation with person ability on same unidimensional linear scale. The fitting of the data to Rasch model (Rasch diagnostic) was tested by both numeric (Anderson LR and Wald test) and graphical method. Suitable visualization like Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) and Person Item Map (PIM) were plotted in RA.

Further a quadratic allocation of all AWWs into 4 quadrants were done as per the ability estimation (Rasch score) and adjusted numbers of SAM/MAM children in her center.

ResultsThe item easiness parameter ({beta}) value related to Diarrhoeal assessment was lowest (-2.32, -2.91 to -1.73) and related to peer assessment consequential action (2.009, 1.669-2.348)) was highest (most difficult). Anderson LR test (LR=31.32, df=24, p=0.079) showed the absence of global outliers. Quadrant analysis using the permutations of ability score and adjusted burden of malnutrition further mapped 41/197 (20.8%) FLWs to low ability -high burden quadrant and 44/197(25%) as low ability low burden quadrant.

ConclusionRASCH assessment may address the innate challenges to maintain homogeneity, discrimination capacity and linearity in a raw score-based measurement construct. The monitoring strategy developed on this thus may offer a judicious, pragmatic and thematic approach to supportive supervision in CSAM program.",NA,medrxiv

Algorithms that learn robust models by estimating invariant properties across time periods for domain generalization (DG) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) might be suitable to proactively mitigate dataset shift.

ObjectiveTo characterize the impact of temporal dataset shift on clinical prediction models and benchmark DG and UDA algorithms on improving model robustness.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this cohort study, intensive care unit patients from the MIMIC-IV database were categorized by year groups (2008-2010, 2011-2013, 2014-2016 and 2017-2019). Tasks were predicting mortality, long length of stay, sepsis and invasive ventilation. Feedforward neural networks were used as prediction models. The baseline experiment trained models using empirical risk minimization (ERM) on 2008-2010 (ERM[08-10]) and evaluated them on subsequent year groups. DG experiment trained models using algorithms that estimated invariant properties using 2008-2016 and evaluated them on 2017- 2019. UDA experiment leveraged unlabelled samples from 2017-2019 for unsupervised distribution matching. DG and UDA models were compared to ERM[08-16] models trained using 2008-2016.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Main performance measures were area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), area-under-the-precision-recall curve and absolute calibration error. Threshold-based metrics including false-positives and false-negatives were used to assess the clinical impact of temporal dataset shift and its mitigation strategies.

ResultsIn the baseline experiments, dataset shift was most evident for sepsis prediction (maximum AUROC drop, 0.090; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.080-0.101). Considering a scenario of 100 consecutively admitted patients showed that ERM[08-10] applied to 2017-2019 was associated with one additional false-negative among 11 patients with sepsis, when compared to the model applied to 2008-2010. When compared with ERM[08-16], DG and UDA experiments failed to produce more robust models (range of AUROC difference, -0.003-0.050).

Conclusions and RelevanceDG and UDA failed to produce more robust models compared to ERM in the setting of temporal dataset shift. Alternate approaches are required to preserve model performance over time in clinical medicine.

Among those who received two doses of vaccination it was further less at 1/33 (3%). The mortality among unvaccinated patients was 16/3301 (0.5%) while there was no mortality among the vaccinated. Among those who received two doses of vaccination there was a 66% relative risk reduction in ICU stay and 81% relative risk reduction in mortality.

ConclusionsThere was a significant reduction in ALOS, ICU requirement, mortality & treatment cost in patients who had completed two doses of vaccination. These findings may be used in motivating public and promoting vaccination drive.",NA,medrxiv

The gold standard reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) cannot keep up with the high demand alone, therefore alternative diagnostic tests are needed. Here we present ADESSO (Accurate Detection of Evolving SARS-CoV-2 through SHERLOCK Optimisation), an optimised version of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) assay. After an extensive validation on 983 clinical samples, we demonstrated that ADESSO has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100% on extracted RNA, comparable to RT-qPCR. Its performance on unextracted samples still allows the detection of the more infectious 75% of the COVID-19 positive population, making it suitable for point-of-care (POC) testing. Interestingly, our in parallel comparison of 390 matching swab and gargle samples showed consistently lower viral loads in gargle specimens. We also validated ADESSO for the detection of the B.1.1.7 variant and demonstrated that ADESSO is adaptable to any variant of concern in less than one week, a critical feature now that worrisome SARS-CoV-2 variants are spreading all around the world.",NA,medrxiv

These vaccines are being administered in a two-dose schedule from 16 Jan 2021. This study deals with the clinical profile of individuals who developed COVID infection post-COVID vaccination.

This is the first study of similar nature in India.

MethodologyThe study population comprised of individuals who were detected to be COVID positive 04 weeks post-vaccination and were compared with individuals detected positive within the first 04 weeks of vaccination. Data was collected in a digital questionnaire format and analyzed with SPSS v-23 software. Clinical features were profiled in detail. Chi-square analysis was done to find out the association of various demographic features with the severity of the disease.

ResultsIn the study population, fever was the commonest symptom (75.1%) followed by anosmia (72.1%), and shortness of breath (16.3%). There was a lower incidence of fever, cough, dyspnea, and requirement of hospitalization in the study population as compared to the control group and previous epidemiological data. The time required for complete recovery and disease severity was favorable in our study population. There was a significant correlation in the rate of hospitalization among the study group and the comparative group (p=0.0001) and between the number of dosage of COVID vaccine with the lowest SpO2 recorded (p=0.001).

The role of MAIT cells in acute intestinal infections, especially at the mucosal level, is not well known. Here, we analyzed the presence and phenotype of MAIT cells in duodenal biopsies and paired peripheral blood samples, in patients during and after culture-confirmed Vibrio cholerae O1 infection. Immunohistochemical staining of duodenal biopsies from cholera patients identified MAIT cells in the lamina propria, but not in the lining of villous and crypt epithelia. We observed significantly higher frequencies of duodenal MAIT cells at the acute stage (day 2) of V. cholerae infection as compared to late convalescence (day 30, p = 0.0049). By flow cytometry, we showed that duodenal MAIT cells are more activated than peripheral MAIT cells (p < 0.01 across time points), although there were no significant differences between duodenal MAITs at day 2 and day 30. We found fecal markers of intestinal permeability and inflammation to be correlated with the loss of duodenal (but not peripheral) MAIT cells, and single-cell sequencing revealed differing T cell receptor usage between the duodenal and peripheral blood MAIT cells.

Prolongued oro-tracheal intubation is associated to an increased risk of dysphagia and bronchial aspiration. Purpose of this study was to investigate swallowing disorders in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

MethodsThis was a retrospective study analysing a consecutive cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our Hospital. Data concerning dysphagia were collected according to the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and related to demographic characteristics, clinical data, ICU Length-Of-Stay (LOS) and MV parameters.

ResultsFrom March 2 to April 30 2020, 31 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were evaluated by speech and language therapists (SLT). Twenty-five of them were on MV (61% through endotracheal tube and 19% through tracheostomy); median MV lenght was 11 days. Seventeen (54.8%) patients presented dysphagia; a correlation was found between first GUSS severity stratification and MV days (p < 0.001), ICU LOS (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.03) and tracheostomy (p = 0.042). No other correlations were found. At 16 days, 90% of patients had fully recovered; a significant improvement was registered especially during the first week (p < 0.001).

ConclusionCompared to non-COVID-19 patiens, a higher rate of dysphagia was reported in COVID-19 patients, with a more rapid and complete recovery. A systematic early SLT evaluation of COVID-19 patients on MV may thus be useful to prevent dysphagia-related complications.",NA,medrxiv

Chest X-Ray is the diagnostic gold-standard to confirm correct placement, with the downsides of both the need for critical care patients mobilization and intrinsic actinic risk. Other potential methods to confirm NGT placement have shown lower accuracy compared to chest X-ray; ETCO2 and pH analysis have singularly yet investigated as an alternative to the gold standard. Aim of this study was to determine thresholds in combine measurements of ETCO2 and pH values, at which correct NGT positioning can be confirmed with the highest accuracy.

Material & Methodsa prospective, multicenter, observational trial; a continuous cohort of eligible patients was allocated to two arms, to identify clear cut-off threshold able to detect correct NGT tip positioning with the maximal accuracy. Patients underwent general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation; in the first group difference between tracheal and esophageal ETCO2 values were assessed. In the second group difference between esophageal and gastric pH values were determined.

Resultsfrom November 2020 to March 2021, 85 consecutive patients were enrolled: 40 in the ETCO2 group and 45 in the pH group. The ETCO2 ROC analysis for predicting NGT tracheal misplacement demonstrate an optimal ETCO2 cutoff value of 25.5 mmHg, where both sensitivity than specificity reach 1.0 (AUC 1.0, p < 0.001). The pH ROC analysis for predicting NGT correct gastric placement demonstrated the optimal pH cutoff value at 4.25, with a mild diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.79, p < 0.001).

DiscussionA device capable of combining the presence of a negative marker with a positive marker could be accurate enough in identifying the correct NGTs positioning. Further studies are required to validate the reproducibility of these results by a specific device, whose accuracy also ought to be compared with standard chest X-ray.

The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular inflammatory interactome, particularly the cytokines and transcriptome regulatory network in heroin addicts undergoing withdrawal, compared to healthy controls (HCs). Twenty-seven cytokines were simultaneously assessed in 41 heroin addicts, including 20 at the acute withdrawal (AW) stage and 21 at the protracted withdrawal (PW) stage, and 38 age- and gender-matched HCs. Disturbed T-helper(Th)1/Th2, Th1/Th17, and Th2/Th17 balances, characterized by reduced interleukin (IL)-2, elevated IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17A, but normal TNF-, were present in the AW subjects. These imbalances were mostly restored to the baseline at the PW stage. However, the cytokines TNF-, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, and IL-17A remained dysregulated. This study also profiled exosomal long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA in the plasma of heroin addicts, constructed co-expression gene regulation networks, and identified lncRNA- mRNA-pathway pairs specifically associated with alterations in cytokine profiles and Th1/Th2/Th17 imbalances.

According to ESICM guidelines, hypotension was defined as two systolic arterial pressure (SAP) measurements < 80 mmHg and / or a mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg, or a drop in SAP of more than 50 mmHg or more than 25% from baseline, or a decrease in MAP by more than 30% from baseline and / or clinical signs/symptoms of inadequate perfusion.

MATERIALS AND METHODSFrom May 2014 to February 2019, a prospective, controlled, randomised, three-arm, parallel-group trial was performed in our tertiary hospital. In the IVCUS group (I, 132 patients) and passive leg raising test group (L, 148 patients), a pre-anaesthesia volume optimization was achieved following a fluid response protocol. In control group (C, 149 patients), no specific intervention was performed.

RESULTS474 patients were collected. In group I, hypotension rate was 35%. In group L hypotension rate was 44%. In group C hypotension rate was 46%. An 11% reduction rate in hypotension (95% CI -1 to -24%, P=0.047) was observed between the group I and the group C.

Recent studies demonstrated that experiences of workplace violence lead to symptoms of burnout, which may impact future decisions regarding use of physical restraints on agitated patients. To capture the dynamic interactions between clinicians and agitated patients under their care, we applied qualitative system dynamics methods to develop a model that describes causal feedback mechanisms of clinician burnout and the use of physical restraints to manage agitation.

MethodsWe convened an interprofessional panel of clinician stakeholders and agitation experts for a series of model building sessions to develop the current model. The panel derived the final version of our model over ten sessions of iterative refinement and modification, each lasting approximately three to four hours. We incorporated findings from prior studies on agitation and burnout as a result of workplace violence, identifying interpersonal and psychological factors likely to influence our outcomes of interest to form the basis of our model.

ResultsThe final model resulted in five main sets of feedback loops that describe key narratives regarding the relationship between clinician burnout and agitated patients becoming physically restrained: (1) use of restraints decreases agitation and risk of assault, leading to increased perceptions of safety and decreasing use of restraints in a balancing feedback loop which stabilizes the system; (2) clinician stress leads to a perception of decreased safety and lower threshold to restrain, causing more stress in a negatively reinforcing loop; (3) clinician burnout leads to a decreased perception of colleague support which leads to more burnout in a negatively reinforcing loop; (4) clinician burnout leads to negative perceptions of patient intent during agitation, thus lowering threshold to restrain and leading to higher task load, more likelihood of workplace assaults, and higher burnout in a negatively reinforcing loop; and (5) mutual trust between clinicians causes increased perceptions of safety and improved team control, leading to decreased clinician stress and further increased mutual trust in a positively reinforcing loop.

ConclusionsOur system dynamics approach led to the development of a robust qualitative model that illustrates a number of important feedback cycles that underly the relationships between clinician experiences of workplace violence, stress and burnout, and impact on decisions to physically restrain agitated patients. This work identifies potential opportunities at multiple targets to break negatively reinforcing cycles and support positive influences on safety for both clinicians and patients in the face of physical danger.",NA,medrxiv

Previous infodemiology studies showed that social media discourse could be analyzed to assess the most concerning adverse events (AE) caused by drugs.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate mild AEs of Sputnik V based on a participatory trial conducted on Telegram in the Russian language. We compared AEs extracted from Telegram with other limited databases on Sputnik V and other COVID-19 vaccines. We explored symptom co-occurrence patterns and determined how counts of administered doses, age, gender, and sequence of shots could confound the reporting of AEs.

Materials and MethodsWe collected a unique dataset consisting of 11,515 self-reported Sputnik V vaccine AEs posted on the Telegram group, and we utilized natural language processing methods to extract AEs. Specifically, we performed multi-label classifications using the deep neural language model BERT ""DeepPavlov"", which we pre-trained on a Russian language corpus and applied to the Telegram messages. The resulting AUC score was 0.991. We chose symptom classes that represented the following AEs: fever, pain, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headache, insomnia, lymph node enlargement, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and diarrhea.

ResultsThe results of the retrospective analysis showed that females reported more AEs than males (1.2-fold, P<.001). In addition, there were more AEs from the first dose than from the second dose (1.13-fold, P<.001), and the number of AEs decreased with age ({beta} = .05 per year, P<.001). The results also showed that Sputnik V AEs were more similar to other vector vaccines (132 units) compared with mRNA ones (241 units) according to the average Euclidean distance between the vectors of AE frequencies. Elderly Telegram users reported significantly more (5.6-fold on average) systemic AEs than their peers, according to the results of the phase III clinical trials published in The Lancet. However, the AEs reported in Telegram posts were consistent (Pearson correlation r=.94, P=.02) with those reported in the Argentinian post-marketing AE registry.

ConclusionAfter receiving the Sputnik V vaccination, Telegram users complained about pain (47%), fever (47%), fatigue (34%), and headache (25%). The results showed that the AE profile of Sputnik V was comparable with other COVID-19 vaccines. Examining the sentinel properties of participatory trials (which is subject to self-reporting biases) could still provide meaningful information about pharmaceutics, especially if only a limited amount of information on AEs is provided by producers.",NA,medrxiv

Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; blocking rate of about 95.5% cannot prevent the spread of the COVID19 epidemic in Shanghai. The strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Shanghai government is not only very effective but also completely necessary.

Despite the vaccine being locally and freely available in the entire country. Comparing crude coverage between localities and population groups is misleading because of differing age structures in different population groups. In order to describe inequalities in COVID19 vaccine initiation we determined differences in age-specific dose 1 vaccine coverage between the main population groups in Israel, and characterised the influence of age on vaccine coverage within each of these groups.

MethodsWe obtained daily doses administered by municipality and age from the Ministry of Health, and demographic data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. We determined whether the relative proportion of people vaccinated in each age group (15-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+) changed by population group (General Jewish, Ultra-Orthodox and Arab) using ANOVA and quantified association between age, population group and vaccine coverage using binomial regression.

Results8,507,723 individuals in 268 localities were included. Compared with the General Jewish population, vaccine coverage was lower among the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox populations and lowest in the Ultra-Orthodox population in all age groups. Gaps between population groups differed according to age group (p<0.001). In all populations, coverage decreased with decreasing age (p<0.001). The Ultra-orthodox population was the least vaccinated in all age groups relatively to those aged 60 and over

ConclusionsIn all age groups, the Ultra-Orthodox population had the lowest vaccine coverage. The younger the age group, the more Ultra-Orthodox Jews are diverging from their age peers in terms of initiating COVID19 vaccination. These findings suggest generational differences in terms of vaccination behaviour in this group.

A common example is to use a 3-digit code from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), to represent a collection of several 4-digit coded diseases. More recently, data-driven studies are using associations with risk factors to cluster diseases, leading this article to reconsider the assumptions needed to study a composite endpoint of several potentially distinct diseases. An important assumption is that the (possibly multivariate) associations are the same for all diseases in a composite endpoint (not heterogeneous). Therefore, multivariate measures of heterogeneity from meta-analysis are considered, including multi-variate versions of the I2 and Q statistics. Whereas meta-analysis offers tools to test heterogeneity of clustering studies, clustering models suggest an alternative heterogeneity test, of whether the data are better described by one, or more, clusters of elements with the same mean. The assumptions needed to model composite endpoints with a proportional hazards model are also considered. It is found that the model can fail if one or more diseases in the composite endpoint have different associations. Tests of the proportional hazards assumption can help identify when this occurs. It is emphasised that in multi-stage diseases such as cancer, some germline genetic variants can strongly modify the baseline hazard function and cannot be adjusted for, but must instead be used to stratify the data.",NA,medrxiv

After decades using non-biological synthetic implants, from the 90s onwards biological membranes of animal or human origin were introduced - the so called acellular biological matrices - beginning a new era in abdominal wall defects correction.

MethodsThirty patients underwent repair for different abdominal wall deformities, with acellular matrices of bovine pericardium, in a total of 40 anatomically individualized implants. The median follow-up was 22 months, with patients evaluated clinically and radiologically. In three cases, biopsies of the implanted areas were performed, allowing histological analysis of the material.

ResultsThere was no recurrence of hernias in any of the cases, both clinically and radiologically. There was also no record of hematomas, infections or any phenomenon of a local or systemic reaction nature. Radiologically, it was not possible to visualize the matrices at the implantation site in any of the analysed postoperative periods. Biopsies showed important tissue neoformation replacing the implanted membranes, with important deposition of collagen, normal-looking cellularized tissue, and absence of foreign body reactions.

ConclusionsThe analysed matrices showed similarity to other biological membranes described in the international literature. Representing an important update and conceptual evolution, biological matrices must be incorporated into the therapeutic arsenal in abdominal wall repairs.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was undertaken based on record review. Data was extracted from files of patients admitted to a tertiary-care burn centre in Lahore, Pakistan from January 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. Univariate preselection was used to prepare multivariate logistic regression models for each outcome of interest (survival and LOS). Multivariate models were tested and compared to other models.

ResultsIncreasing TBSA of burn was positively associated with reduced survival and prolonged length of stay. Advancing age and full-thickness burns independently predicted decreased survival. Burn etiology showed prognostic value: petrol-flame burns predicted decreased survival and prolonged LOS; scald was associated with improved survival-odds and shorter LOS. The Survival-model consisted of (1) Baux score, (2) TBSA>40% and (3) serum albumin <3.5g/dl (AUC=0.968, Nagelkerke R2=0.797). The LOS-model consisted of (1) TBSA2 and (2) serum albumin concentration (AUC= 0.832, Nagelkerke R2 =0.408).

ObjectiveTo determine which biomarkers of the inflammation-related proteome are associated with all-cause dementia, Alzheimers disease (AD), or vascular dementia (VD).

DesignAnalyses were performed in a case-cohort study design based on an ongoing German population-based cohort study.

SettingSerum samples of study participants were collected at baseline (2000-20002), and participants were followed up for 17 years. Information about a dementia diagnosis was collected during follow-up via collection of medical records from general practitioners.

ParticipantsAscertainment of potential dementia development during follow-ups was conducted for 6,284 study participants aged 50-75 years at baseline. Biomarker measurements were performed in a randomly collected sample of 1,435 participants and all incident dementia cases of the rest of the cohort (n=393).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause dementia, AD and VD were the primary outcomes of this analysis.

ResultsBiomarkers were analyzed in 504 all-cause dementia cases (mean age, 67.0 [SD, 5.1] years; 262 female [52.0%], and 242 male [48.0%]) and 1,278 controls (mean age, 61.9 [standard deviation (SD): 6.5] years; 703 female [55.0%], and 575 male [45.0%]). Among the dementia cases, 163 participants developed AD and 195 VD. After correction for multiple testing, 58 biomarkers were statistically significantly associated with all-cause dementia, 22 with AD, and 33 with VD incidence. All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. Besides single biomarker associations, we identified four biomarker clusters based on the strongest and independently associated biomarkers CX3CL1, EN-RAGE, LAP TGF-beta-1 and VEGF-A. CX3CL1 (Odds ratio [95%-confidence interval] per 1 standard deviation increase: 1.41 [1.24-1.60]) and EN-RAGE (1.41 [1.25-1.60]) were associated with all-cause dementia incidence, EN-RAGE (1.51 [1.25-1.83]) and LAP TGF-beta-1 (1.46 [1.21-1.76]) with AD incidence, and VEGF-A (1.43 [1.20-1.70]) with VD incidence. All named associations were stronger among APOE {varepsilon}4 negative subjects.

Conclusion and RelevanceThis study shows for the first time that the majority of inflammation-related proteins measured in serum samples (58 of 72 tested (80.6%)) are associated with all-cause dementia incidence. Future studies should not only concentrate on single biomarkers but also the complex relationships in biomarker clusters.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich biomarkers of the inflammatory proteome are risk factors for dementia?

FindingsAfter correction for multiple testing, in this large prospective cohort study (n=1,782), 58 of 72 tested (80.6%) inflammation-related proteins were associated with all-cause dementia.

Furthermore, 22 and 33 were significantly associated with Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia. Due to high inter-correlation, only four biomarkers (CX3CL1, EN-RAGE, LAP TGF-beta-1, VEGF-A) were independently associated with dementia outcomes.

MeaningThe underlying pathophysiology of dementia development might involve complex inflammatory protein clusters, and the identified biomarkers might be promising new drug targets, early diagnostic markers, or parts of prediction models.",NA,medrxiv

DesignCross Sectional Study

SubjectsA total 141,547,436 spectacle lens sales records from an international European lens manufacturer between the years 1998 and 2016.

MethodsAnonymized patient spectacle lens sales data including refractive error information was provided by a major European spectacle lens manufacturer. Data from the Gutenberg Health Survey was digitized to allow comparison of a representative, population-based sample to the spectacle lens sales data. A bootstrap analysis was completed to assess the comparability of both datasets. The expected level of vision impairment due to myopia at age 75 was calculated for both datasets using a previously published risk estimation equation combined with a saturation function.

Main Outcome MeasuresComparability of spectacle lens sales data on refractive error to typical population surveys of refractive error and its potential utility to predict vision impairment due to refractive error.

ResultsEquivalent estimates of the population distribution of spherical equivalent refraction can be provided from spectacle lens data within limits. For myopia, the population distribution was equivalent to the Gutenberg Health Survey ([&le;] 5% deviation) for levels [&le;]-2.0 dioptres, while for hyperopia the distribution was equivalent ([&le;] 5% deviation) for levels [&ge;] +3.0 diopters. The estimated rates of vision impairment due to myopia were not statistically significantly different ({chi}2 = 182, DoF = 169, p = 0.234) between the spectacle lens data and Gutenberg Health Survey data.

ConclusionsThe distribution of refractive error and hence the risk of vision impairment due to refractive error within a population can be determined using spectacle lens sales data. Pooling this type of data from multiple industry sources could provide a cost effective, timely and globally representative mechanism for monitoring the evolving epidemiology of refractive error and associated vision impairment.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsA questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was completed by 348 physicians who met the study inclusion criteria, from 20 out of 36 randomly selected healthcare facilities in Yerevan, Armenia, between Dec 2017 to Sep 2018. The aim of the questionnaire was to identify physicians awareness of and attitudes to HPV-related cervical cancer and the Gardasil vaccine. Responses were analysed using SPSS software (Version 16).

ResultsThe responding physicians displayed a respectable level of knowledge and awareness regarding vaccination with regard to some characteristics (e.g. more than 81% knew that HPV infection was commonly asymptomatic, 87% were knew that HPV infection was implicated in most cervical cancers and 87% knew that cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer amongst women) but low knowledge in others and poor understanding of key issues such as the age at which women were most likely to develop cervical cancer (only 15% answered correctly); whether or not the vaccine should be administered to people who had already been affected (27% answered correctly) and whether sexually active young people should be treated for infection before vaccination (26%). Lack of confidence within the surveyed groups regarding the value of vaccination and, in particular concerns over the reasons for administering it to certain age cohorts, was driven by misconceptions.

ConclusionsArmenian physicians awareness of vaccine characteristics, the reasons for their inclusion in the national vaccination programme and the characteristics of the diseases they treat can be poor. The study further suggests that drivers of vaccine hesitancy are complex, may not be consistent from vaccine to vaccine, and may vary from generation to generation. The Armenian healthcare sector may need to provide additional training, awareness-raising and educational activities to improve understanding of and trust in vaccination programmes.

Although hypoxemia is an important risk factor for mortality of children with respiratory infections, the optimal SpO2 threshold for defining hypoxemia is uncertain in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We derived a SpO2 threshold for hypoxemia from well children in Bangladesh residing at low altitude.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled well, 3-35 month old children participating in a pneumococcal vaccine evaluation in Sylhet district, Bangladesh between June and August 2017. Trained health workers conducting community surveillance measured the SpO2 of children using a Masimo Rad-5(R) pulse oximeter with a wrap sensor. We used standard summary statistics to evaluate the SpO2 distribution, including whether the distribution differed by age or sex. We considered the 2.5th, 5th, and 10th percentiles of SpO2 as possible lower thresholds for hypoxemia.

ResultsOur primary analytical sample included 1,470 children (mean age 18.6 +/- 9.5 months). Median SpO2 was 98% (interquartile range, 96-99%), and the 2.5th, 5th, and 10th percentile SpO2 was 91%, 92%, and 94%. No child had a SpO2 <90%. Children 3- 11 months old had a lower median SpO2 (97%) than 12-23 month olds (98%) and 24- 35 month olds (98%) (p=0.039). The SpO2 distribution did not differ by sex (p=0.959).

ConclusionA SpO2 threshold for hypoxemia derived from the 2.5th, 5th, or 10th percentile of well children is higher than <90%. If a higher threshold than <90% is adopted into LMIC care algorithms then decision-making using SpO2 must also consider the childs clinical status to minimize misclassification of well children as hypoxemic. Younger children in lower altitude LMICs may require a different threshold for hypoxemia than older children. Evaluating the mortality risk of sick children using higher SpO2 thresholds for hypoxemia is a key next step.

Key MessagesO_LIWhat is the key question? The ideal peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) threshold for defining hypoxemia among children in low-income and middle-income countries is unknown.
C_LIO_LIWhat is the bottom line? A SpO2 threshold for hypoxemia set at any of the 2.5th, 5th, or 10th percentiles of SpO2 measurements from well children in a lower altitude setting is higher than the <90% threshold currently recommended by the World Health Organization.
C_LIO_LIWhy read on? This study is a possible model for other research seeking to establish SpO2 thresholds for hypoxemia in children and provides evidence for health policy makers to consider before implementing higher SpO2 thresholds than currently in practice in lower altitude settings of low-income and middle-income countries.

Indeed, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at the alpha frequency reduced left frontal alpha power and was associated with a higher response rate than placebo stimulation in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in a recent double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial.

MethodsIn this current study, we aimed to replicate such successful target engagement by delineating the effects of a single session of bifrontal tACS at the individualized alpha frequency (IAF-tACS) on alpha oscillations in patients with MDD. Electrical brain activity was recorded during rest and while viewing emotionally-salient images before and after stimulation to investigate if the modulation of alpha oscillation by tACS exhibited specificity with regards to valence.

ResultsIn agreement with the previous study of tACS in MDD, we found that a single session of bifrontal IAF-tACS reduced left frontal alpha power during the resting state when compared to placebo. Furthermore, the reduction of left frontal alpha oscillation by tACS was specific for stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, these effects on left frontal alpha power were not found in healthy control participants.

ConclusionTogether these results support an important role of tACS in reducing left frontal alpha oscillations as a future treatment for MDD.

Those wishing to assess life impact face several challenges: First, various measurement instruments are available, including of global functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and well-being. Existing reviews have tended to focus on one of these domains; consequently, a comprehensive overview is lacking. Second, the extent to which such instruments truly capture distinct concepts is unclear. Third, many available scales conflate symptoms and their impact, thus undermining much needed analyses of associations between the two.

Methods and analysisA scoping umbrella review will examine existing reviews of life impact measures for use with 6-24-year-olds in the context of mental health and well-being research. We will systematically search five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science), and conduct systematic record screening, data extraction and charting based on methodological guidance by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Data synthesis will involve the tabulation of scale characteristics, feasibility, and measurement properties, and the use of summary statistics to synthesize how these instruments operationalize life impact.

Ethics and disseminationThis study will provide a comprehensive road map for researchers and clinicians seeking to assess life impact in youth mental health, providing guidance in navigating available measurement options. We will seek to publish the findings in a leading peer-reviewed journal in the field. Formal research ethics approval will not be required.

Therefore, it is essential to study PD at a local, regional, and continental scale in order to increase the knowledge on disease etiology.

OBJECTIVEWe aimed to investigate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to PD in a new Swedish case-control cohort.

METHODSPD patients (n=929) and matched population-based controls (n=935) from the southernmost county in Sweden were included in the cohort. Information on environmental exposures was obtained using questionnaires at inclusion. Genetic analyses included a genome-wide association study (GWAS), haplotype assessment, and a risk profile analysis using cumulative genetic risk scores.

RESULTSThe cohort is a representative PD case-control cohort (64% men, mean age at diagnosis = 67 years, median Hoehn and Yahr score = 2.0), in which previously reported associations between PD and environmental factors, such as tobacco, could be confirmed. We describe the first GWAS of PD solely composed of PD patients from Sweden, and confirm associations to well-established risk alleles in SNCA. In addition, we identified a potential novel, population-specific PD risk variant in the PLPP4 locus (rs12771445) along with a risk haplotype in the region.

CONCLUSIONSThis work provides an in-depth description of a new PD case-control cohort from southern Sweden in which we identified a potential novel PD risk locus, PLPP4. Replication studies are needed to determine whether the PLPP4 locus is associated with PD in Sweden, and on a global scale.",NA,medrxiv

Two key issues that likely contribute to these failures are i) the lack of clear definition for MSC and ii) poor quality of reporting in MSC clinical studies. To address these issues, we propose a modified Delphi study to establish a consensus definition for MSC and clinical reporting guidelines for MSC.

Methods and analysisWe will conduct a three-round international modified Delphi Survey. Findings from a recent scoping review examining how MSC are defined and reported in preclinical and clinical studies were used to draft the initial survey for round one of our Delphi. Participants will include a  core group of individuals as well as researchers whose work was captured in our scoping review. The core group will include stakeholders from different research fields including developmental biology, translational science, research methods, regulatory practices, scholarly journal editing, and industry. The first two survey rounds will be online, and the final round will take place in person. Each participant will be asked to rate their agreement on potential MSC definition characteristics and reporting items using a Likert scale. After each round, we will analyse data to determine which items have reached consensus for inclusion/exclusion, and then develop a revised questionnaire for any new items, or items that did not reach consensus.

Ethics and disseminationThis study received ethical approval from the Ottawa Health Research Network Research Ethics Board. To support the dissemination of our findings, we will use an evidence-based  integrated knowledge translation approach to engage knowledge users from the inception of the research. This will allow us to develop a tailored end-of-project knowledge translation plan to support and ensure dissemination and implementation of the Delphi results.

SettingA prospective longitudinal observation design was utilized in this study.

ParticipantsWe recruited participants for an online panel survey from chat groups on Chinese social media platforms.

Data collectionThere were 7 waves of interviews. Data were obtained by an online survey. A special administrative WeChat group was established to manage the follow-up data collection.

MeasuresSeveral mental responses and prevention patterns were each measured by single questionnaire items. Uncertainty stress was measured by 5-point scale. An irrational beliefs about prevention variable was comprised 5 common misconceptions, which manifested during the COVID-19 epidemic in China.

AnalysisSixty-two participants completed all observation points and were included in the study. The Mann-Kendall Test was used to assess changing trends across the seven observation points. The nonparametric linear mixed effects model was used to examine the association between uncertainty stress and mental and behavioral responses.

ResultsThe mean uncertainty stress did not change significantly over the observation period (T:-0.911, P>0.05). This trend was also true for perceived risk (T: -0.141, P>0.05), perceived severity (T: 1.010, P>0.05), self-efficacy for prevention (T: 0.129, P>0.05), and prevention behavior (T: 0.728, P>0.05). There was a statistically significant downwards trend in irrational beliefs about prevention (T: -4.993, p < 0.01), sleep (T: -2.499, p < 0.05), emotions (T: -5.650, p < 0.01), and lifestyle (T:-5.978, p < 0.01). The results showed that uncertainty stress was positively associated with irrational beliefs ({beta}: 0.16298, p<0.01). The more uncertainty stress, the worse was their sleep ({beta}: 0.02070, p<0.05), emotions ({beta}: 0.03462, p<0.01), and lifestyle({beta}: 0.02056, p<0.05). High levels of uncertainty stress was negatively associated with self-efficacy for prevention and prevention behavior, {beta}value was =-1.33210 (p<0.01) and -0.82742 (p<0.01), respectively.

ConclusionAs the COVID-19 virus spreads around the globe, it is currently in epidemic status in some countries, in sporadic status in another countries, and it will eventually transition to a sporadic infection status. This study provides new information on changing trends of mental responses and prevention patterns from the COVID-19 epidemic as the transition to a sporadic infection period takes place.

Many countries also have incomplete vital registration systems, hampering excess mortality estimation. Here, we fitted a dynamic transmission model to satellite imagery data on burial patterns in Mogadishu, Somalia during 2020 to estimate the date of introduction, transmissibility and other epidemiologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in this low-income, crisis-affected setting.

MethodsWe performed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting with an age-structured compartmental COVID-19 model to provide median estimates and credible intervals for the date of introduction, the basic reproduction number (R0) and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Mogadishu up to September 2020.

ResultsUnder the assumption that excess deaths in Mogadishu February-September 2020 were directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection we arrived at median estimates of October-November 2019 for the date of introduction and low R0 estimates (1.3-1.5) stemming from the early and slow rise of excess deaths. The effect of control measures on transmissibility appeared small.

ConclusionSubject to study assumptions, a very early SARS-CoV-2 introduction event may have occurred in Somalia. Estimated transmissibility in the first epidemic wave was lower than observed in European settings.",NA,medrxiv

In Costa Rica, almost 319 000 cases have been reported during the first third of 2021, contrasting to the 590 000 fully vaccinated people. In the pre-vaccination period (the year 2020), this country accumulated 169 321 cases and 2185 deaths.

MethodsTo describe the clinical presentations at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 in Costa Rica during the pre-vaccination period, we implemented a symptom-based clustering using machine learning to identify clusters or clinical profiles among 18 974 records of positive cases. Profiles were compared based on symptoms, risk factors, viral load, and genomic features of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence.

ResultsA total of seven COVID-19 clinical profiles were identified, which were characterized by a specific composition of symptoms. In the comparison between clusters, a lower viral load was found for the asymptomatic group, while the risk factors and the SARS-CoV-2 genomic features were distributed among all the clusters. No other distribution patterns were found for age, sex, vital status, and hospitalization.

ConclusionDuring the pre-vaccination time in Costa Rica, the clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 were described in seven profiles. The host co-morbidities and the SARS-CoV-2 genotypes are not specific of a particular profile, rather they are present in all the groups, including asymptomatic cases. In further analyses, these results will be compared against the profiles of cases during the vaccination period.

Studies of the nasal metabolome demonstrate virus-specific changes that sometimes correlate with viral load and disease severity. Here, we evaluate the nasopharyngeal metabolome of COVID-19 infected individuals and report several small molecules that may be used as potential therapeutic targets. Specimens were tested by qRT-PCR with target primers for three viruses: Influenza A (INFA), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2, along with asymptomatic controls. The nasopharyngeal metabolome was characterized using an LC-MS/MS-based small-molecule screening kit capable of quantifying 141 analytes. A machine learning model identified 28 discriminating analytes and correctly categorized patients with a viral infection with an accuracy of 96% (R2=0.771, Q2=0.72). A second model identified 5 analytes to differentiate COVID19-infected patients from those with INFA or RSV with an accuracy of 85% (R2=0.442, Q2=0.301). Specifically, LysoPCaC18:2 concentration was significantly increased in COVID19 patients (P< 0.0001), whereas beta-hydroxybutyric acid, Met SO, succinic acid, and carnosine concentrations were significantly decreased (P< 0.0001). This study demonstrates that COVID19 infection results in a unique NP metabolomic signature with carnosine and LysoPCaC18:2 as potential therapeutic targets.

Significance StatementEfforts to elucidate how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host has become a global priority. To identify biomarkers for potential therapeutic interventions, we used a targeted metabolomics approach evaluating metabolite profiles in the nasal mucosa of COVID-19 patients and compared metabolite profiles to those of other respiratory viruses (influenza A, RSV). We identified a COVID-19-specific signature characterized by changes to LysoPCaC18:2, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, Met SO, succinic acid, and carnosine. Carnosine is a promising potential target against SARS-CoV-2 as it has been shown to interfere with binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor. This study provides compelling evidence for the use of metabolomics as an avenue for the identification of novel drug targets for viral respiratory infections in the nasopharynx.",NA,medrxiv

Effective inflammatory responses integrate molecular and cellular functions to prevent further tissue damage, initiate repair, and restore homeostasis, while futile or dysfunctional responses allow escalating injury, delay recovery, and may hasten death2. Elevation of white blood cell count (WBC) and altered levels of other acute phase reactants are cardinal signs of inflammation, but the dynamics of these changes and their resolution are not established3,4. Patient responses appear to vary dramatically with no clearly defined signs of good prognosis, leaving physicians reliant on qualitative interpretations of laboratory trends4,5.

We retrospectively, observationally studied the human acute inflammatory response to trauma, ischemia, and infection by tracking the longitudinal dynamics of cellular and serum markers in hospitalized patients. Unexpectedly, we identified a conserved pattern of recovery defined by co-regulation of WBC and platelet (PLT) populations. Across all inflammatory conditions studied, recovering patients followed a consistent WBC-PLT trajectory shape that is well-approximated by exponential WBC decay and delayed linear PLT growth. This recovery trajectory shape may represent a fundamental archetype of human physiologic response at the cellular population scale, and provides a generic approach for identifying high-risk patients: 32x relative risk of adverse outcomes for cardiac surgery patients, 9x relative risk of death for COVID-19, and 5x relative risk of death for myocardial infarction.",NA,medrxiv

AutoScore, a machine learning based algorithm, was used to generate point based clinical scores from the study sample which was divided into training, validation and testing cohorts. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC).

ResultsAmong the 119,468 admissions, 10,693 (9.0%) developed AKI. 8,491 were stage 1 (79.4%), 906 stage 2 (8.5%) and 1,296 stage 3 (12.1%). The AKI Risk Score (AKI-RiSc) was a summation of the integer scores of 6 variables: serum creatinine, serum bicarbonate, pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. AUC of AKI-RiSc was 0.730 (95% CI: 0.713 - 0.747), outperforming an existing AKI Prediction Score model which achieved AUC of 0.665 (95% CI: 0.646 - 0.679) when evaluated on the same test cohort. At a cut-off of 4 points, AKI-RiSc had a sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 46.7%.

ConclusionAKI-RiSc is a simple point based clinical score that can be easily implemented on the ground for early identification of AKI in high-risk patients and potentially be applied in healthcare settings internationally.",NA,medrxiv

By analyzing >1700 genome sequences representing 17% of confirmed cases from 23-January-2020 to 26-January-2021, we reveal the effects of fluctuating control measures on the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Hong Kong. Despite numerous importations, only three introductions were responsible for 90% of locally-acquired cases, two of which circulated cryptically for weeks while less stringent measures were in place. We found that SARS-CoV-2 within-host diversity was most similar among transmission pairs and epidemiological clusters due to a strong transmission bottleneck through which similar genetic background generates similar within-host diversity.

The COVID-19 epidemic started to gain traction in France in March 2020. Sub-national hospital admissions and deaths were then recorded daily and served as the main policy indicators. Concurrently, mobile phone positioning data have been curated to determine the frequency of users being colocalized within a given distance. Contrarily to individual tracking data, these can provide a proxy of human contact networks between subnational administrative units. Motivated by numerous studies correlating human mobility data and disease incidence, we developed predictive time series models of hospital incidence between July 2020 and April 2021. Adding human contact network analytics such as clustering coefficients, contact network strength, null links or curvature as regressors, we found that predictions can be improved substantially (more than 50%) both at the national and sub-national for up to two weeks. Our sub-national analysis also revealed the importance of spatial structure, as incidence in colocalized administrative units improved predictions. This original application of network analytics from co-localisation data to epidemic spread opens new perspectives for epidemics forecasting and public health.

However, information on longer-term clinical sequelae following acute COVID-19 is emerging. We followed a group of persons with COVID-19 in Zambia at two months to assess persistent symptoms.

MethodsIn September 2020, we re-contacted participants from SARS-CoV-2 prevalence studies conducted in Zambia in July 2020 whose PCR tests were positive. Participants with valid contact information were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that captured demographics, pre-existing conditions, and types and duration of symptoms. We describe the frequency and duration of reported symptoms and used chi-square tests to explore variability of symptoms by age group, gender, and underlying conditions.

ResultsOf 302 participants, 155 (51%) reported one or more acute COVID-19-related symptoms in July 2020. Cough (50%), rhinorrhoea (36%) and headache (34%) were the most frequently reported symptoms proximal to diagnosis. The median symptom duration was 7 days (IQR: 3-9 days). At a median follow up of 54 days (IQR: 46-59 day), 27 (17%) symptomatic participants had not yet returned to their pre-COVID-19 health status. These participants most commonly reported cough (37%), headache (26%) and chest pain (22%). Age, sex, and pre-existing health conditions were not associated with persistent symptoms.

ConclusionA notable percentage of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in July still had symptoms nearly two months after their diagnosis. Zambia is implementing  post-acute COVID-19 clinics to care for patients with prolonged symptoms of COVID-19, to address their needs and better understand how the disease will impact the population over time.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsAdministrative data and medical record review were used to identify patients from 3-36 months of age hospitalized from 2011-2019 with uncomplicated CAP. Patients were considered treated if they received antibiotics for more than 2 inpatient days and/or at discharge, and not treated if they received 2 or fewer inpatient days and no antibiotics at discharge. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, radiologic findings, viral testing, illness severity, length of stay and 30-day hospital readmissions were assessed and compared according to antibiotic treatment.

Results322 CAP cases were included. 266/322 (83%) received antibiotics for more than 48 hours and/or at discharge. 56 patients received 2 or fewer inpatient days of antibiotics and no antibiotics at discharge; the majority received no inpatient antibiotics. There were no differences between the two groups in illness severity, length of stay or hospital readmissions. The proportion of patients treated with antibiotics decreased from 88% (2011-2013) to 66% during the most recent years studied (2017-2019).

ConclusionThere was no difference in outcome of uncomplicated CAP in previously healthy children less than 36 months of age between those treated and not treated with antibiotics. Additional tools are needed to facilitate identification of viral CAP in young children and decrease unnecessary antibiotic use.",NA,medrxiv

Early cohort studies have suggested declines in levels of antibodies in individuals, associated with, for example, illness severity, age and co-morbidities. This protocol focuses on the seroprevalence among primary health care providers (PHCPs) in Belgium. They manage the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in addition to other patients and therefore play an essential role in the efficient organisation of health care. Currently, evidence is lacking on 1. how many PHCPs get infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium, 2. the rate at which this happens, 3. their clinical spectrum, 4. their risk factors, 5. the effectiveness of the measures to prevent infection and 6. the accuracy of the serology-based point-of-care test in a primary care setting.

Methods and analysisThis study will be set up as a prospective cohort study. General practitioners (GPs) and other PHCPs (working in a GP practice) will be recruited via professional networks and professional media outlets to register online to participate. Registered GPs and other PHCPs will be asked at each testing point (n=9) to perform a capillary blood sample antibody point-of-care test (OrientGene(R)) and complete an online questionnaire. The primary outcomes are the prevalence and incidence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in PHCPs during a 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes include the longevity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been granted by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Antwerp/University of Antwerp (Belgian registration number: 3002020000237). Alongside journal publications, dissemination activities include the publication of monthly reports to be shared with the participants and the general population through the publicly available website of the Belgian health authorities (Sciensano).

Used alone, sequence-based biomarkers neither accurately capture patient dynamics nor the tumor-immune microenvironment. To better understand the tumor ecology of this immune microenvironment, we used complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3) sequence recovery counts of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and quantified tumor infiltration by sequences recovered from patient tumors by applying a generalized diversity index (GDI) to CDR3 sequence distributions across two distinct ccRCC cohorts. GDI can be understood as a curve over a continuum of diversity scales and allows sensitive characterization of distributions to capture richness, evenness, and subsampling uncertainty, along with other important metrics. For example, richness quantifies the total unique sequence count, while evenness quantifies similarities across sequence frequencies. We observed significant differences in receptor sequence diversity across gender and race. Further, our analysis revealed that patients with larger and more clinically aggressive tumors had increased richness of recovered tumoral CDR3 sequences, specifically in those from T-cell receptor alpha and B-cell immunoglobulin lambda light chain. We identified a novel and robust measure of distribution evenness, using GDIs inflection point (IP). High IP values associated with improved overall survival, suggesting that normal-like sequence distributions lead to better outcomes. Our results propose a new quantitative tool that can be used to better characterize patient-level differences related to immune cell infiltration and, can be used to identify unique characteristics of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte heterogeneity in ccRCC and other malignancies.",NA,medrxiv

The representation of observations routinely recorded in clinical practice is the first step to use these data in several research tasks. Anonymised data were extracted from 11 158 first emergency admission episodes (AE) in older adults. Irregular records from 23 laboratory blood tests and vital signs were normalized and regularised into daily bins and represented as numerical multivariate time-series (MVTS). Unsupervised Hidden Markov Models (HMM) were trained to represent each day of each AE as one of 17 state spaces. The visual clinical interpretation of these states showed remarkable differences between patients who died at the end of the AE and those who were discharged. All states had marked features that allowed their clinical interpretation and differentiation between those associated with the patients disease burden, their physiological response to this burden or the stage of admission. The most evident relationships with hold-out clinical information were also confirmed by Chi-square tests, with two states strongly associated with inpatient mortality (IM) and 12 states (71%) associated with at least one admission diagnosis. The potential of these data representations on prediction of hospital outcomes was also explored using Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) models, with higher prediction performance observed when models were trained with MVTS data compared to HMM state spaces. However, the outputs of generative and discriminative analyses were complementary. For example, highest ranking features of the best performing RF model for IM (ROC-AUC 0.851) resembled the laboratory blood test and vital sign variables characterising the  Early Inflammatory Response-like state, itself strongly associated with IM. These results provide evidence of the capability of generative models to extract biological signals from routinely collected clinical data and their potential to represent interpretable patients trajectories for future research in hypothesis generation or prediction modelling.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was determined in 2547 individuals between the ages of 10 to 86 years, by the Wantai total antibody ELISA. We also compared to seroprevalence using the haemagglutination test (HAT) to evaluate its usefulness in carrying out serosurveys.

ResultsThe overall seropositivity rate was 24.46%, while seropositivity by HAT was 18.9%. Although the SARS-CoV-2 infection detection rates by PCR were highest in the population between the ages of 20 to 60 years of age, the seropositivity rates were equal among all age groups. The seropositivity rate was highest in the 10 to 20 age group (34.03%), whereas the PCR positivity rates was 9.8%. Differences in the PCR positivity rates and seropositivity rates were also seen in 60- to 70-year-olds (8.9% vs 30.4%) and in individuals >70 year (4.1% vs 1.2%). The seropositivity rates of the females was 29.7% (290/976), which was significantly higher (p<0.002) than in males 21.2% (333/1571).

ConclusionsA high seroprevalence rate (24.5%) was seen in all age groups in the CMC suggesting that a high level of transmission was seen during this area. The PCR positivity rates, appear to underestimate the true extent of the outbreak and the age groups which were infected.",NA,medrxiv

However, in April-May 2021 there was a significant deterioration in the epidemiological situation.

In this work results of the next statistical analysis of the daily data associated with New Coronavirus COVID-19 infection of confirmed (C), recovered (R), deaths (D) and infection rate (I) cases of the population of Georgia in the period from March 01, 2021 to May 31, 2021 are presented. It also presents the results of the analysis of two-week forecasting of the values of C, D and I. The information was regularly sent to the National Center for Disease Control & Public Health of Georgia and posted on the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Avtandil1948/.

The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, the following results were obtained.

Georgias ranking in the world for Covid-19 monthly mean values of infection and deaths cases in spring 2021 (per 1 million population) was determined. Among 156 countries with population [&ge;] 1 million inhabitants in May 2021 Georgia was in the 11 place on new infection cases and in the 14 place on Death.

A comparison between the daily mortality from Covid-19 in Georgia in spring 2021 with the average daily mortality rate in 2015-2019 shows, that the largest share value of D from mean death in 2015-2019 was 25.3 % (22.05.2021), the smallest 1.42 % (15.03.2021).

Data about infection rate of the population of Georgia with Covid-19 according to traffic light system shown, that Georgia in April and May 2021 was in the red zone.

The statistical analysis of the daily and decade data associated with coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic of confirmed, recovered, deaths cases and infection rate of the population of Georgia are carried out. Maximum daily values of investigation parameters are following: C = 2171 (05.05.2021), R = 2038 (17.05.2021), D = 33 (22.05.2021), I = 8.05 % (04.05.2020). Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: C = 1258 (3 Decade of April 2021), R = 1283 (2 Decade of May 2021), D = 24 (2 Decade of May 2021), I = 6.54 % (1 Decade of May 2021).

It was found that as with September 2020 to February 2021 [8], in spring 2021 the regression equations for the time variability of the daily values of C, R and D have the form of a tenth order polynomial.

Mean values of speed of change of confirmed -V(C), recovered - V(R), deaths - V(D) and infection rate V(I) coronavirus-related cases in different decades of months in the spring 2021 were determined. Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: V(C) = +37 cases/day (1 Decade of April 2021), V(R) = +36 cases/day (3 Decade of April 2021), V(D) = +0.6 cases/day (3 Decade of April 2021), V(I) = + 0.17 %/ day (2 and 3 decades of April 2021).

Cross-correlations analysis between confirmed COVID-19 cases with recovered and deaths cases shows, that the maximum effect of recovery is observed 9 and 13 days after infection, and deaths - after 12-17 days.

Comparison of real and calculated predictions data of C, D and I in Georgia are carried out. It was found that two-week daily and mean two-week real values of C, D and I practically fall into the 67% - 99.99% confidence interval of these predicted values for the specified time periods.

The comparison of data about C and D in Georgia (GEO) with similar data in Armenia (ARM), Azerbaijan (AZE), Russia (RUS), Turkey (TUR) and in the World (WRL) is also carried out.",NA,medrxiv

This can have a detrimental impact on quality of care, the national response to the pandemic and its aftermath.

AimsA longitudinal design provided follow-up evidence on the MH(changes in the prevalence of disease over time) of NHS staff working in a remote health board in Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated the determinants of MH outcomes over time.

MethodA two-wave longitudinal study was conducted from July to September 2020. Participants self-reported levels of depression(PHQ-9), anxiety(GAD-7), and mental well-being(WEMWBS) at baseline and again 1.5 months later.

ResultsThe analytic sample of 169 participants, working in community(43%) and hospital(44%) settings reported substantial levels of probable clinical depression, anxiety and low mental well-being(MWB) at baseline(depression:30.8%, anxiety:20.1%, low-MWB:31.9%). Whilst the MH of participants remained mostly constant over time, the proportion of participants meeting the threshold for clinical anxiety increased to 27.2% at follow-up. Multivariable modelling indicated that working with, and disruption due to COVID-19 were associated with adverse MH changes over time.

ConclusionsHSCWs working in a remote area with low COVID-19 prevalence, reported similar levels of substantial anxiety and depression as those working in areas of the UK with high rates of COVID-19 infections. Efforts to support HSCW MH must remain a priority and should minimize the adverse effects of working with, and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

However, most studies are cross-sectional, precluding causal inferences. The high levels of uncertainty and fear at a global level that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to investigate the longitudinal role of HRV in stress resilience. The present study examined whether HRV, measured about 2 years earlier (Time 0), could predict emotion regulation strategies and daily affect in healthy adults during the May 2020 lockdown (Time 1). Moreover, we evaluated the association between HRV measures, emotion regulation strategies, subjective perception of COVID-19 risk, and self-reported depressive symptoms at Time 1. Higher tonic HRV at Time 0 resulted a significant predictor of a stronger engagement in more functional emotion regulation strategies, as well as of higher daily feelings of safeness and reduced daily worry at Time 1. Moreover, depressive symptoms negatively correlated with HRV and positively correlated with the subjective perception of COVID-19 risk at Time 1. Current data support the view that HRV might be not only a marker but also a precursor of resilience under stressful times.",NA,medrxiv

We whole genome sequenced 1,152 M. tuberculosis isolates from participants diagnosed with tuberculosis within prisons and in the community in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil from 2014 to 2019. By integrating timed phylogenies and detailed location data, we reconstructed probabilistic transmission histories. M. tuberculosis sequences from incarcerated and non-incarcerated people were closely phylogenetically related. We found that 57% of recent community-wide tuberculosis cases were attributable to transmission from individuals with an incarceration history, 2.6% of the population. Further, we find genomic evidence that the prison system disseminates M. tuberculosis genotypes through frequent transfers across the state. This population-wide genomic transmission reconstruction framework can be applied to identify key environments amplifying infectious disease transmission to prioritize public health interventions.

The two approaches are conceptually similar, but differ in two aspects. Firstly, the MEM involves a log transformation of incidence data, while the WHO method operates on the original scale. Secondly, the MEM uses more than one observation from each past season to compute intensity thresholds, fixing the total number to include. The WHO method uses only the highest value from each season. To assess the impact of these choices on thresholds we perform simulation studies which are based on re-sampling of ILI data from France, Spain, Switzerland and the US. When no transformation is applied, a rather large proportion of season peaks are classified as high or very high intensity. This can be mitigated by a logarithmic transformation. When fixing the total number of included past observations, thresholds increase the more seasons are available. When only few are available, there is a high chance of classifying new season peaks as high or very high intensity. We therefore suggest using one observation per season and a log transformation, i.e. a hybrid of the default settings of the MEM and WHO methods.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsWe analyzed data from MDS-UPDRS Part IB and Part II from the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Assessment of Isradipine for PD (STEADY-PD3) study, with at least one annual follow-up over two years. We divided the sample into categories of follow-up visit (between 0 and 12-months, and 13 and 24-months) and the number of ES for each part of the scale between participants who started symptomatic treatment and those who did not (STx-yes/no). We assessed ES differences between participants STx in each follow-up visit using Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kaplan-Meier analyses.

ResultsOf 331 participants observed for months 0 to 12, 288 (87%) developed ES, and 182 (55%) started STx. For Part IB, the median number of ES did not significantly differ between the STx groups (Z=-0.86, p = 0.39), while for Part 2, the number of ES was significantly higher for the STx-yes group (Z=-2.38, p=0.02). Of 148 participants who continued to be observed for months 13 to 24, 114 (77%) developed ES, and 62 (42%) started STx.

It is unknown whether reported genetic loci and polygenic scores (PGSs) for cardiometabolic traits are transferable to South Asians, and whether PGSs have utility in clinical settings.

MethodsUsing data from 22,000 British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals with linked electronic health records from the Genes & Health cohort (G&H), we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and characterised the genetic architecture of coronary artery disease (CAD), body mass index (BMI), lipid biomarkers and blood pressure. We applied a new technique to assess the extent to which loci from GWAS in EUR samples were transferable. We tested how well existing findings from EUR studies performed in genetic risk prediction and Mendelian randomisation in G&H.

ResultsTrans-ancestry genetic correlations between G&H and EUR samples for the tested traits were not significantly lower than 1, except for BMI (rg=0.85, p=0.02). We found evidence for transferability for the vast majority of loci from EUR discovery studies that were sufficiently powered to replicate in G&H. PGSs showed variable transferability in G&H, with the relative accuracy compared to EUR (ratio of incremental r2/AUC) [&ge;]0.95 for HDL-C, triglycerides, and blood pressure, but lower for BMI (0.78) and CAD (0.42). We observed significant improvement in categorical net reclassification in G&H (NRI=3.9%; 95% CI 0.9-7.0) when adding a previously developed CAD PGS to clinical risk factors (QRISK3). We used transferable loci as genetic instruments in trans-ancestry Mendelian randomisation and found evidence of an increased CAD risk for higher LDL-C and BMI, and for lower HDL-C in G&H, consistent with our findings for EUR samples.

ConclusionsThe genetic loci for CAD and its risk factors are largely transferable from EUR studies to British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, whereas the transferability of PGSs varies greatly between traits. Our analyses suggest clinical utility for addition of PGS to existing clinical risk prediction tools for this population.

Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis is the first study to explore the transferability of GWAS findings and PGSs for CAD and related cardiometabolic traits in British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals from a cohort with real-world electronic clinical data.
C_LIO_LIWe propose a new approach to assessing transferability of GWAS loci between populations, which can serve as a new methodological standard in this developing field.
C_LIO_LIWe find evidence of overall high transferability of GWAS loci in British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. BMI, lipids and blood pressure show the highest transferability of loci, and CAD the lowest.
C_LIO_LIThe transferability of PGSs varied between traits, being high for HDL-C, triglycerides and blood pressure but more modest for CAD, BMI and LDL-C.
C_LIO_LIOur results suggest that, for some traits, the use of transferable GWAS loci improves the robustness of Mendelian randomisation estimates in non-Europeans.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIThe polygenic score for CAD derived from genetic studies of European individuals improves reclassification on top of clinical risk factors in British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. The improvement was driven by identification of more cases in younger individuals (25-54 years old), and of controls in older individuals (55-84 years old).
C_LIO_LIIncorporation of the polygenic score for CAD into risk prediction models is likely to prevent cardiovascular events and deaths in this population.

ObjectiveThe aim is to determine whether a home-based supervised exercise programme (PrAISED - promoting activity, independence, and stability in early dementia) can generate a positive social return on investment (SROI).

MethodsSROI was conducted as part of a randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing PrAISED with usual care. Wellbeing valuation was used to compare the costs of the programme with the monetised benefits to participants, carers, and healthcare service providers.

ResultsThe PrAISED programme generated SROI ratios ranging from {pound}3.46 to {pound}5.94 for every {pound}1 invested. Social value was created from improved physical activity, increased confidence, more social connection and PrAISED participants using healthcare services less often than usual care.

ConclusionHome-based supervised exercise programmes can generate a positive SROI for people with early dementia.

We report trends in vaccination intention and associated determinants from surveys in the adult general population in Greece.

MethodsFour cross-sectional phone surveys were conducted in November 2020, February, April and May 2021 on nationally representative samples of adults in Greece. Multinomial logistic regression was used on the combined data of the surveys to evaluate independent predictors of vaccination unwillingness/uncertainty.

ResultsVaccination intention increased from 67.6% in November 2020 to 84.8%. in May 2021. Individuals aged 65 years or older were more willing to get vaccinated (May 2021: 92.9% vs. 79.5% in 18-39 years, p<0.001) but between age-groups differences decreased over time. Vaccination intention increased substantially in both sexes, though earlier among men than women and was higher in individuals with postgraduate studies (May 2021: 91.3% vs. 84.0% up to junior high).

An understanding of the immune response associated with protection could facilitate rapid licensure of new vaccines.

MethodsData from a randomised efficacy trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in the UK was analysed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG by multiplex immunoassay, pseudovirus and live neutralising antibody at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and non-infected vaccine recipients. Weighted generalised additive models for binary data were applied to symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection data from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 recipients. Cubic spline smoothed log antibody levels, and weights were applied to account for potential selection bias in sample processing. Models were adjusted for baseline risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsHigher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. Vaccine efficacy of 80% against primary symptomatic COVID-19 was achieved with an antibody level of 40923 (95% CI: 16748, 125017) and 63383 (95% CI: 16903, not computed (NC)) for anti-spike and anti-RBD, and 185 (95% CI: NC, NC) and 247 (95% CI: 101, NC) for pseudo- and live-neutralisation assays respectively.

This exploratory analysis examined the effects of ENDS delivering different amounts of nicotine on cigarette abstinence up to 24-week follow-up, in comparison to placebo or a behavioral substitute.

MethodsThis four-arm parallel-group, randomized placebo-controlled trial took place at two academic medical centers in USA (Penn State Hershey and Virginia Commonwealth University). Participants were current adult smokers (N=520) interested in reducing but not planning to quit. They received brief advice and were randomized to one of four 24-week conditions, receiving either an eGo-style ENDS paired with 0, 8 or 36 mg/ml nicotine liquid (double-blind) or a cigarette-shaped tube, as a cigarette substitute (CS). Self-reported daily cigarette consumption and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) were measured at all study visits. Outcomes included intent-to-treat, self-reported 7-day cigarette abstinence, biochemically confirmed by exhaled CO at 24 weeks after randomization.

ResultsAt 24 weeks, significantly more participants in the 36 mg/ml condition (14/130, 10.8%) than in the 0 mg/ml condition (1/130, 0.8%) and the CS condition (4/130, 3.1%) were abstinent (relative risk = 14 [95% CI=1.9-104.9] and 3.5 [95% CI=1.2-10.4], respectively). The abstinence rate in the 8 mg/ml condition was 4.6% (6/130).

ConclusionsWhen smokers seeking to reduce smoking tried ENDS, few quit smoking in the short term. However, if smokers continued to use an ENDS with cigarette-like nicotine delivery, a greater proportion completely switched to ENDS, as compared with placebo or a cigarette substitute.

IMPLICATIONSThe extent to which use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) for smoking reduction leads to cigarette abstinence in smokers with no plans to quit smoking was unclear. This randomized trial found that ENDS with nicotine delivery approaching that of a cigarette are more effective in helping ambivalent smokers to quit cigarette smoking.",NA,medrxiv

Introduction of Rotarix(R) rotavirus vaccine (RV1) in Malawi in 2012 has reduced rotavirus-associated hospitalisations and diarrhoeal mortality. However, RV1 impact on gastroenteritis severity remains unknown. We conducted a hospital-based surveillance study to assess RV1 impact on gastroenteritis severity in children aged <5 years, in Malawi.

MethodsStool samples were collected from children hospitalised with acute gastroenteritis from December 2011 - October 2019. Gastroenteritis severity was determined using Ruuska and Vesikari scores. Rotavirus was detected in stool using Enzyme Immunoassay. Rotavirus genotypes were determined using nested RT-PCR. Associations between RV1 vaccination and gastroenteritis severity were investigated using adjusted linear regression.

ResultsIn total, 3,159 children were recruited. After adjusting for Mid-Upper Arm Circumference, age, weight, gender and receipt of other vaccines, all-cause gastroenteritis severity scores were 2.21 units lower (95% CI 1.85, 2.56; p<0.001) among RV1-vaccinated (n=2,224) compared to RV1-unvaccinated children (n=935); the decrease was comparable between rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative cases in all age groups. The reduction in severity score was observed against every rotavirus genotype, although the magnitude was smaller among those infected with G12P[6] compared to the remaining genotypes (p=0.011). Other than RV1 vaccination, age was the only variable associated with gastroenteritis severity. Each one-year increment in age was associated with a decrease of 0.43 severity score (95% CI 0.26, 0.60; p<0.001).

ConclusionOur findings provide additional evidence of RV1 impact in a high disease burden, low-income country, lending further support to Malawis rotavirus vaccine programme.

SummaryIn a long-term hospital-based surveillance study in Malawi, we found evidence of the reduction in gastroenteritis severity among hospitalised RV1-vaccinated children infected with both homotypic and heterotypic rotavirus strains and off-target RV1 vaccine effects against non-rotavirus diarrhoeal severity.",NA,medrxiv

This can involve sub-national redistribution, short-term relocations as well as international migration. In this paper, we combine detailed location data from Facebook measuring the location of approximately 6 million daily active Facebook users in 5km2 tiles in the UK with census-derived population estimates to measure population mobility and redistribution. We provide time-varying population estimates and assess spatial population changes with respect to population density and four key reference dates in 2020 (First lockdown, End of term, Beginning of term, Christmas). We also show how the timing and magnitude of observed population changes can impact the size of epidemics using a deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission. We estimate that between March 2020 and March 2021, the total population of the UK has declined and we identify important spatial variations in this population change, showing that low-density areas have experienced lower population decreases than urban areas. We estimate that, for the top 10% highest population tiles, the population has decreased by 6.6%. Further, we provide evidence that geographic redistributions of population within the UK coincide with dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns and movement restrictions, as well as seasonal patterns of migration around holiday dates. The methods used in this study reveal significant changes in population distribution at high spatial and temporal resolutions that have not previously been quantified by available demographic surveys in the UK. We found early indicators of potential longer-term changes in the population distribution of the UK although it is not clear how these changes may persist after the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

The current study aimed at assessing the altered expression of genes functioning in inflammation within the early stage (ES)and advanced stage (AS) atherosclerotic plaques obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and identifying biomarker panel/sthat may detect the status of plaque stages using peripheral blood samples.

MethodsA section of ES and ASplaques and normal left internal mammary arteries (LIMA) were obtained from 8 patients undergoing theCABG surgery. Total RNA isolated was analysed for mRNA and miRNAexpression profile by Affymetrix arrays. Significant number of mRNAs was found to be differentially expressed in ES and ASplaque tissues relative to LIMA. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs in the two plaque stages was also performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Database.

ResultsThe mRNAs were found to be involved in critical inflammatory processes such as Toll-like receptor signalling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Few miRNAs targeting these mRNAs were also altered in the two plaque conditions. QRT-PCR results showedsimilar expression pattern of few of themRNAs and miRNAsin peripheral blood of same patients relative to healthy controls.

MethodsWe quantified time in days from symptom onset until testing (latency one) and delay in test results report (latency two) using freely available country-wide open data from Mexico and Colombia. Directed acyclic graphs were built to determine which associations were appropriate to assess. Stratification by margination status, state and hospitalization status was used to determine corresponding associations.

ResultsIn almost all the study period latency two was longer than latency one. Median latency one was 3 (IQR 0-6) days and latency two 7 (IQR 4-11) days in Colombia, while in Mexico they were 3 (IQR 1-5) days and 4 (IQR 3-6) days. In Colombia, worse margination status prolonged latency two. In Mexico, a lower number and percentage of point-of-care (POC) tests in areas with worse margination.

ConclusionPOC tests must be used as a widespread means to reduce latency two, and until then should be prioritized in areas with longer latency two. An unequal distribution of this resource should be avoided.",NA,medrxiv

However, the publics hesitation has created major difficulties to the promotion of the vaccine. By investigating the relationship between health literacy and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, as well as the potential moderating role of stress, the present study would provide critical insights for tailoring vaccine-promotion strategies.

ObjectiveThe two-fold research purpose is: i) address the effect of health literacy on peoples attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine, ii) clarify the role of stress in this effect.

MethodsWith structured questionnaires, an online survey was conducted to evaluate general publics COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, health literacy, and perceived stress. In total, 560 responses were collected, and moderated regression analysis was conducted to test the effect of health literacy on vaccine hesitancy among people with different levels of stress.

ResultsA total of 560 participants aged over 18 years were included in this study. About 39.8% of the respondents reported vaccine hesitancy, and this rate is higher among those aged 20-30 years old (83%) and female (71.3%). The results showed people with higher level of health literacy are less likely to have vaccine hesitancy ({beta} =-2.00, 95%CI= [-3.00[~] -0.99]). However, this effect was only among those with lower to moderate level of stress ({beta} =-3.43, p<0.001), among the people with high stress, no significant effect of health literacy was found ({beta} =-0.53, p>0.05).

ConclusionsBy focusing on the effect of health literacy on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, the findings showed education program increasing individuals health literacy may also effectively reduce the publics vaccine hesitancy and promote accepting attitude. However, for people with high level of stress, other health programs need to be developed to enhance their positive attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. In conclusion, promotion strategies should be tailored for different populations, with considering individual factors such as health literacy and stress.",NA,medrxiv

Female reproductive tract organs express coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs); suggesting they may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection however the susceptibility of ovary/follicle/oocyte to the same is still elusive. Co-morbidities like obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease etc. increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These features are common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), warranting further scope to study SCARFs expression in ovary of these women.

Materials and methodsSCARFs expression in ovary and ovarian tissues of women with PCOS and healthy women was explored by analyzing publically available microarray datasets. Transcript expression of SCARFs were investigated in mural and cumulus granulosa cells (MGCs and CGCs) from control and PCOS women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).

ResultsMicroarray data revealed that ovary expresses all genes necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. PCOS women mostly showed down-regulated/unchanged levels of SCARFs. MGCs and CGCs from PCOS women showed lower expression of receptors ACE2, BSG and DPP4 and protease CTSB than in controls. MGCs showed lower expression of protease CTSL in PCOS than in controls. Expression of TMPRSS2 was not detected in both cell types.

ConclusionsHuman ovarian follicle may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lower expression of SCARFs in PCOS indicate that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the ovary may be lesser in these women than controls. This knowledge may help in safe practices at IVF settings in the current pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

Moreover, we evaluated how community adherence, measured with an index of social isolation, would mediate the lockdown effect on COVID-19 mortality.

MethodsThis ecological study assessed the legislations published until June 30, 2020, in the Brazilian state of Ceara. We performed a systematic review and classification of restrictive norms and estimated their immediate effect on social isolation, measured by an index based on mobile data, and the subsequent impact on COVID-19 mortality (three weeks later). A mediation analysis was performed to estimate the effect of rigid lockdown on mortality that was explained for effective social isolation.

ResultsThe social isolation index showed an increase of 11.9% (95% CI: 2.9% - 21%) during the days in which a rigid isolation norm (lockdown) was implemented. Moreover, this rigid lockdown was associated with a reduction of 26% (95% CI: 21% - 31%) in the three-week-delayed mortality. We also calculated that the rigid lockdown had the indirect effect, i.e., mediated by adherence to social isolation, of reducing COVID-19 mortality by 38.24% (95% CI: 21.64% to 56.07%). Therefore, the preventive effect of this norm was fully explained by the actual population adherence, reflected in the social isolation index. On the other hand, mandatory mask use was associated with 11% reduction in COVID-19 mortality (95% CI: 8% -13%).

ConclusionsWe estimated the effect of quarantine regulations on social isolation and evidenced that a rigid lockdown law led to a reduction of COVID-19 mortality in one state of Brazil. In addition, the mandatory masks norm was an additional determinant of the reduction of this outcome.",NA,medrxiv

However, the speed and simplicity of POCTs also makes their use appealing to clinicians in high-income countries (HICs), despite their having greater laboratory accessibility. Although also part of the clinical routine in HICs, the utility of POCTs is relatively unknown in such settings as compared to others.

In a Swedish paediatric emergency department (PED) where POCT use is routine, we aimed to characterize health care providers perspectives on the clinical utility of POCTs and explore their implementation in the local setting; to compare such experiences to those reported in other settings; and finally, to gather requests for ideal novel POCTs.

DesignQualitative study using focus group discussions. A data-driven content analysis approach was used for analysis.

SettingThe PED of a secondary paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden.

ParticipantsTwenty-four health care providers clinically active at the PED were enrolled in six focus groups.

ResultsA range of POCTs was routinely used. The emerging theme Utility of POCTs is double-edged illustrated the perceived utility of POCTs. While POCT services were considered to have clinical and social value, the local testing practice was named to distract from the care for patients. Requests were made for novel POCTs and their implementation.

ConclusionDespite their clinical integration, deficient implementation routines limit the benefits of POCT services to this well-resourced paediatric clinic. As such deficiencies are shared with other settings, it is suggested that some characteristics of POCTs and of their utility are less related to resource level and more to policy deficiency. To address this, we propose the appointment of skilled laboratory personnel as ambassadors to hospital clinics offering POCT services, to ensure higher utility of such services.

C_LIO_LIOur main finding is that deficient implementation routines limit benefit of POCT services in this well-resourced setting, strongly indicating that such deficiencies are irrespective of resource level, and more related to policy deficiency.

It may however also result from asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, or even full-blown but undiagnosed and unregistered cases from which patients recovered at home. Here we present a population screening for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in Polish citizens (N=501) who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were collected in Wrocaw (Lower Silesia) on 15th and 22nd May 2021. Sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N=22) or from vaccinated citizens (N=14) served as positive controls.

Sera were tested with Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG and IgA (quantitative) that contain specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens: NCP, RBD, Spike S2, E, ACE2, PLPro protein, and antigens for exclusion cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV 229E Np, HCoV NL63 Np.

Within the investigated population of healthy individuals who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found that 35.5% (178 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 52.3% (262 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA; 21.2% of the investigated population developed virus-specific IgG or IgA while being asymptomatic. Anti-RBD IgG, which represents virus-neutralizing potential, was found in 25.6% of individuals (128 out of 501).

These patients, though positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, cannot be identified in the public health system as convalescents due to undiagnosed infections, and they are considered unaffected by SARS-CoV-2. Their contribution to population immunity against COVID-19 should however be considered in predictions and modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, the majority of the investigated population still lacked anti-RBD IgG protection (74.4%); thus vaccination against COVID-19 is still of the most importance for controlling the pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

Materials and MethodsWe used the American ECD approach but made modifications. Our approach included 1) a review of data, 2) a review of current admission practice via consultations with nurses, 3) a review of evidence and policies, 4) workshops with nursing and informatics teams in partnership with the eMR vendor, and 5) team debrief sessions to consolidate findings and decide what data elements should be kept, moved, or removed from the admission form.

ResultsOf 165 data elements in the form, 32% (n=53) had 0% usage, while 25% (n=43) had 100% usage. Nurses perceptions of the forms purpose varied. Eight policy documents specifically prescribed data to be noted at admission. Workshops revealed risks of moving or removing data elements, but also uncovered ways of streamlining the form. Consolidation of findings from all phases resulted in a recommendation to reduce 91% of data elements.

ObjectiveWe describe a consensus-based programme led by international MS experts with the aim of supplementing current guidelines and treatment labels by providing timely recommendations relating to COVID-19 vaccination and the use of cladribine tablets inclinical practice.

MethodsA steering committee (SC) of 10 international MS experts identified 7 clinical questions to answer concerning the use of cladribine tablets and COVID-19 vaccination, which addressed issues relating to patient selection, timing and efficacy, and safety. Clinicalrecommendations to address each question were drafted using available evidence combined with expert opinion from the SC. An extended faculty of 28 MS experts, representing 19 countries, in addition to the SC members, voted on the recommendations. Consensus on recommendations was achieved when [&ge;]75% of respondents expressed an agreement score of 7-9, on a 9-point scale.

ResultsConsensus was achieved on all 13 recommendations. Clinical recommendations are provided on whether all patients with MS receiving cladribine tablets should be vaccinated against COVID-19, and whether they should be prioritized; the timing of vaccination arounddosing of cladribine tablets (i.e., before and after a treatment course); and the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for these patients.

ConclusionsThese expert recommendations provide timely guidance on COVID-19 vaccination in patients receiving cladribine tablets, which is relevant to everyday clinicalpractice.",NA,medrxiv

Using classical random-effects model, they found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with preeclampsia, preterm birth and stillbirth.

Performing MA with low event rates or with few studies may be challenging as MA relies on several within and between study distributional assumptions.

Methodsto assess the robustness of the results provided by Wei et al., we performed a sensitivity analysis using several frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis methods. We also estimated fragility indexes.

ResultsFor eclampsia (patients with Covid-19 vs without), the confidence intervals of most frequentist models contain 1. All beta-binomial models (Bayesian) lead to credible intervals containing 1. The prediction interval, based on DL method ranges from 0.75 to 2.38. The fragility index is 2 for the DL method.

For preterm, the confidence (credible) intervals exclude 1. The prediction interval is broad, ranging from 0.84 to 20.61. The fragility index ranges from 27 to 10.

For stillbirth, the confidence intervals of most frequentist models contain 1. Six Bayesian MA models lead to credible intervals containing 1.The prediction interval ranges from 0.52 to 8.49. The fragility index is 3.

InterpretationGiven the available data and the results of our broad sensitivity analysis, we can only suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated to preterm, and may be associated to preeclampsia.

It is still unclear whether these associations are causal or not. We aim to test whether genetically determined variation within the normal range of thyroid function and hypothyroidism are causally associated with the risk of Alzheimers disease (AD).

MethodsMendelian Randomisation (MR) analyses_using genetic instruments associated with normal range TSH and FT4 levels. Secondary analyses included investigation of the role of hypothyroidism. Bidirectional MR was conducted to address the presence of a potential reverse causal association. Summary statistics were obtained from the ThyroidOmics Consortium and the latest available GWAS meta-analyses.

ResultsMR analyses show a causal association between normal range TSH levels and decreased risk of AD (OR = 0.98, 95% CI=0.97-0.99, p = 0.01). There was no evidence for a causal association between FT4 or hypothyroidism and Alzheimers disease. Bidirectional MR did not show any effect of Alzheimers disease on TSH or FT4.

DesignWe used an agent-based model Covasim and the demographics, policies, and interventions implemented in the state. Using the calibrated model, we simulated possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate due to leakage of infected cases with high-transmission variants, during a period of zero community transmission.

SettingModel calibration covered the first-wave period from early March 2020 to May 2020. Predicted epidemic trajectories were simulated from early February 2021 to late March 2021.

ParticipantsNone (simulation study).

Main outcomesA calibrated model of COVID-19 epidemiology in Queensland; the conditions that could lead to an outbreak; and how likely that situation is to occur given our current levels of testing and vaccination coverage.

ResultsSimulations showed that one infected agent with the ancestral (A.2.2) variant has a 14% chance of crossing a threshold of sustained community transmission (i.e., > 5 infections per day, more than 3 days in a row), assuming no change in the prevailing preventative and counteracting policies. However, one agent carrying a more infectious variant (e.g., B.1.1.7) has a 43% chance of crossing the same threshold; a threefold increase. Doubling the average number of daily tests results in a decrease of this probability from 43% to 33%. Similarly, achieving a coverage of 70% with a vaccine with 70% efficacy would decrease the probability of SCT from a single seed of B.1.1.7 from 43% to 20%, on par with the ancestral strain in a naive population.

ConclusionsThe introduction of even a small number of people infected with high-transmission variants dramatically increases the probability of sustained community transmission in Queensland.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant is 40%-90% more transmissible than the ancestral strain. However, the probabilities of developing sustained community transmission in Queensland, a zero community transmission setting, are unknown.

The newUsing an agent-based model, with the levels of testing observed in Queensland during February-March 2021, we found that as few as 3 agents infected with a highly-transmissible variant lead to an 80% chance of developing sustained community transmission.

The implicationsUntil high vaccine coverage is achieved, a swift implementation of policies and interventions, together with high adherence rates, will be required to minimise the probability of sustained community transmission from high transmission variants.",NA,medrxiv

Many contributing factors, promoting transmission, were suggested, including climate conditions in cooled production rooms favorable for environmental transmission but actual sampling studies are lacking. We aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 contamination of air and surfaces to gain insight in potential environmental transmission in a large Dutch meat processing plant experiencing COVID-19 clusters.

We performed SARS-CoV-2 screening of workers operating in cooled production rooms and intensive environmental sampling during a two-week study period in June 2020. Sampling of air (both stationary and personal), settling dust, ventilation systems, and sewage was performed. Swabs were collected from high-touch surfaces and workers hands. Screening of workers was done using oronasopharyngeal swabs. Samples were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR.

Of the 76 (predominantly asymptomatic) workers tested, 27 (35.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive with modest to low viral loads (Ct[&ge;]29.7).

Additional conditions complicating the diagnosis are the presence of risk factors for PE in almost all patients with COVID-19, as well as the overlap of the clinical presentation between PE and COVID-19. Materials and Methods: [T]herefore we conducted a single-center study at the Heart and Brain Hospital, Pleven in the period December 2020-February 2021. It included 27 consecutively hospitalized patients with recent pneumonia caused by Covid-19 and clinical presentation referring to PE. The cohort was divided into two groups - with and without a definitive diagnosis of PE, proven by CT pulmoangiography. The aim was to find the indicators that predict the presence of PE in patients with acute or Post-acute COVID-19 conditions. Results: Our results show that part of the ECG criteria - S-wave over 1.5 mm in I lead and aVL (p = 0.007), Q-wave in III and aVF (p = 0.020), as well as the D-dimer as quantitative variable (p = 0.025) proved to be independent predictors of PE.

To evaluate the relationship between the COVID-19 epidemic and the possible decrease in deaths from respiratory diseases in Chile. 2 Study the relationship between meteorological variables and severity of COVID-19 with respect to deaths from respiratory diseases from January 2018 to February 2021.

MethodsThe variable number of deaths due to respiratory diseases in Chile was analyzed considering the monthly records of meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and humidity) in each Region of Chile and severity of COVID-19, to evaluate the mortality trend before and after the pandemic. For this, different Non-Observable Heterogeneity Models for Panel Data were used

ResultsOur findings show that among the variables that affect the mortality rate from respiratory diseases, there are the number of deaths from COVID-19 that has a negative effect, the number of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU) that has a positive effect and the minimum temperature with a negative effect. These results are supported by the application of the panel regression with one-way random-effects models.

ConclusionThis study revealed that there is an unexpected reduction in deaths from respiratory diseases in Chile in the post-pandemic period. Therefore, it can be concluded that this variable decreased with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,medrxiv

Determining the source of this observation is essential, as it will define the relative focus on common versus rare genetic variation in case-control and family studies of schizophrenia.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the role of common risk variation in the recurrence risk of schizophrenia, by comparing the polygenic risk scores in familial versus ancestry matched singleton cases of schizophrenia.

DesignWe used the latest genome-wide association study data of schizophrenia (N=166,464) to construct polygenic risk scores in multiplex family members, singleton cases and controls. To account for the high degree of relatedness in the samples, analyses were carried out using a mixed effects logistic regression model with the family structure modeled as a random effect.

SettingPopulation and family based.

ParticipantsWe used a large, homogenous sample of 1,005 individuals from 257 families from the Irish Study of High-Density Schizophrenia Families, 2,224 singleton cases and 2,284 population controls all from the population of the island of Ireland.

ExposuresPolygenic risk scores, diagnostic categories, familial or singleton case status.

Main outcomes and measuresThe primary outcomes were the mixed effects logistic regression results generated from comparison between different groups.

ResultsPolygenic risk scores in singleton cases did not differ significantly from familial cases (p=0.49), rejecting the hypothesis that an increased burden of common risk variation can account for the higher recurrence risk of schizophrenia in multiplex families.

Conclusions and relevanceThis study suggests that a higher burden of common schizophrenia risk variation cannot account for the increased familial recurrence risk of schizophrenia in multiplex families. In the absence of elevated polygenic risk scores in multiplex schizophrenia families, segregation of rare variation in the genome and environmental exposures unique to the families may explain the increased multiplex familial recurrence risk of schizophrenia. These findings also further validate the concept of a genetically influenced psychosis spectrum in multiplex schizophrenia families as shown by a continuous increase of common risk variation burden from unaffected relatives to familial cases of schizophrenia in the families.",NA,medrxiv

However, no standard definitions or indicators exist to assess acceptability, acceptability research with adolescents in LMICs is still limited, and no known reviews synthesise the evidence from Africa.

We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies assessing intervention acceptability with young adults (aged 10-24) in Africa, published between January 2010 and June 2020. This paper maps and qualitatively synthesizes the scope, characteristics, and findings of these studies, including definitions of acceptability, methods used, the type and objectives of interventions assessed, and overall findings on adolescent acceptability.

The review was carried out in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Key word searches generated 4692 unique records and 55 final eligible studies, assessing 60 interventions. Most studies were conducted in Southern Africa, of which 32 jointly in South Africa and Uganda. The majority of interventions assessed for acceptability could be classified as HIV or HPV vaccine interventions (10), E-health (10), HIV testing interventions (8), support group interventions (7) and contraceptive interventions (6). The objectives of most interventions were linked to SDG3, specifically to HIV and sexual and reproductive health. Acceptability was overall high among these published studies. 22 studies provided reasons for acceptability or lack thereof, some specific to particular types of interventions and others common across intervention types.

Our review exposes considerable scope for future acceptability research and review work. This should include: extending acceptability research beyond the health (and particularly HIV) sector and to regions in Africa where this type of research is still scarce; including adolescents earlier, and potentially throughout the intervention process; further conceptualising the construct of acceptability among adolescents and beyond, and examining the relationship between acceptability and uptake.

Moreover, after accounting for covariates, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), temperature, and relative humidity, we found a significant relationship between PM1.0 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1224; p=0.032), PM2.5 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1177; p=0.021), PM10 exposure vs. FEV1 (Coefficient=-0.0703; p=0.019), and PM10 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1204; p=0.006). Further, using the pilot study data, we have performed a power analysis to estimate the sample size for our follow-up main study. Based on the primary null hypothesis that personal PM exposure would not change the FEV1 and FVC of young asthmatics in HK, the lowest sample size that gives 80% power at a 5% significance level is 107. Hence, the sample size (or the total number of participated asthma subjects) expected for the follow-up longitudinal clinical study should be 125 (after adjusting for the non-compliance and withdrawal of subjects). Our pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of research into the effects of personal air pollutant exposure on health condition and health perception. Our follow-up study will address the challenges identified in the pilot study, based on the proposed follow-up actions for subject engagement, data collection, and data analysis.",NA,medrxiv

With implementation underway, little is known about the public perception of such certificates with potential differences in acceptability among individuals.

In March 2021, a self-administered online questionnaire was proposed to all individuals 18 years and older participating in the longitudinal follow-up of population-based seroprevalence studies in Geneva, Switzerland. The questionnaire covered aspects of individual and collective benefits, while allowing participants to select contexts in which vaccination certificates should be presented. Results were presented as the proportion of individuals agreeing or disagreeing with the implementation of vaccination certificates, selecting specific contexts where certificates should be presented, and agreeing or disagreeing with the potential risks related to certificates. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for factors associated with certificate non-acceptance.

Overall, 4,056 individuals completed the questionnaire (response rate 77.6%; mean age 53.3 {+/-} standard deviation 14.4 years; 56.1% were women). About 61.0% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that a vaccination certificate was necessary in certain contexts; and 21.6% believed there was no context where vaccination certificates should be presented. Contexts where a majority of participants perceived a vaccination certificate should be presented included jobs where others would be at risk of COVID-related complications (60.7%), jobs where employees would be at risk of getting infected (58.7%), or to be exempt from quarantine when traveling abroad (56.1%). Contexts where fewer individuals perceived the need for vaccination certificates to be presented were participation in large gatherings (36.9%), access to social venues (35.5%), or sharing the same workspace (21.5%). Younger age, an absence of willingness to get vaccinated, and an absence of belief in vaccination as an important step in surmounting the pandemic were factors associated with certificate non-acceptance.

This large population-based study showed that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland, agreed with the implementation of vaccination certificates in work-related and travel-related contexts. However, this solution was perceived as unnecessary for access to large gatherings or social venues, or to share the same workspace. Differences were seen with gender, age, education, socio-economic status, and vaccination willingness and perception, highlighting the importance of taking personal and sociodemographic variations into consideration when predicting acceptance of such certificates.",NA,medrxiv

Using US county-level data from July 5 and December 28, 2020, the effect of 19 high-risk factors on COVID-19 mortality rate was quantified at each time point with negative binomial mixed models. Then, these high-risk factors were used as controls in two association studies between 40 social determinants and COVID-19 mortality rates using data from the same time points. The results indicate that counties with certain ethnic minorities and age groups, immigrants, prevalence of diseases like pediatric asthma and diabetes and cardiovascular disease, socioeconomic inequalities, and higher social association are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality rates. Meanwhile, more mental health providers, access to exercise, higher income, chronic lung disease in adults, suicide, and excessive drinking are associated with decreased mortality. Our temporal analysis also reveals a possible decreasing impact of socioeconomic disadvantage and air quality, and an increasing effect of factors like age, which suggests that public health policies may have been effective in protecting disadvantaged populations over time or that analysis utilizing earlier data may have exaggerated certain effects. Overall, we continue to recognize that social inequality still places disadvantaged groups at risk, and we identify possible relationships between lung disease, mental health, and COVID-19 that need to be explored on a clinical level.

It has been established that combinations of increased ventilation, improved filtration, and other disinfection techniques can reduce the likelihood of transmission by removing or deactivating the airborne particles that potentially contain infectious material. However, when such guidance is general and qualitative in nature, it is extremely difficult for building managers to make informed decisions, as there is no quantitative information about how much risk reduction is provided. Furthermore, the actions that could be taken almost always require additional energy consumption by the HVAC system, and so in the absence of building-specific analysis, it is possible that chosen strategies might simply be wasting energy without providing meaningful reduction in transmission risk. To address this knowledge gap, we propose simplified steady-state models that can be used to quantify both the expected infection rate and the associated HVAC energy consumption that result from baseline operation and hypothetical changes. The transmission rate is modeled by considering the airborne concentration of infectious particles that would result from the activity-dependent respiration of an infector in the space, the physical dimensions of the space, and operation of the HVAC system. By formulating all disinfection mechanisms in terms of ""equivalent outdoor air"", a common basis is established for comparing and combining different strategies. Energy consumption can then be estimated by considering the change in HVAC variables (e.g., flow rates and temperatures) and applying standard models. To illustrate the insights provided by these models, we present examples of how the proposed analysis can be applied to specific spaces, highlighting the fact that underlying transmission risk (and thus also the energy-optimal disinfection strategies) can vary significantly from building to building and even from space to space within the same building. The overall goal is to empower building managers to fully assess the tradeoff between energy consumption and infection risk so that they can more effectively target their disinfection efforts and take actions that are consistent with current health and sustainability priorities.",NA,medrxiv

As in other types of addiction, it affects a brain region known as prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is important in executive functions and inhibitory control. However, this region was loosely defined, and there was no consensus for that definition. We aimed to use volumetric MRI in finding the defining region of PFC which would be suitable in distinguishing pornography addicted juveniles.

MethodsWe enrolled 30 juveniles (12-16 y.o.) consisting of 15 pornography addiction and 15 non-addiction subjects. We proposed several models of PFC definition from mix-and-matched subregions, consisting of orbitofrontal (OFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; pars orbitalis, opercularis, and triangularis), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate (ACC). Suitable PFC definition was defined as models which volume statistically different between both groups. Brain volumetric was measured using 3D-T1 3T MRI images and analyzed using FreeSurfer(R) for automatic cortical reconstruction and brain segmentation (recon-all command).

ResultsWe found significant differences between groups in 6 models, which mainly included OFC, ACC, and DLPFC, with models devoid of DLPFC had lowest mean differences.

ConclusionThe most suitable definition of PFC for pornography addiction study should consist of OFC, ACC, and especially DLPFC. Inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis was not necessary for this purpose, but may increase effect size if it is included.",NA,medrxiv

A few biological pathways are known to play key roles in regulating sensitive period plasticity across brain development. Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation (DNAm) may provide a means through which life experiences during sensitive periods induce long-term biological changes. In the current study, we investigated the possibility that adversity during sensitive periods led to DNAm changes in genes that regulate the timing and duration of sensitive periods in development.

MethodsUsing childhood adversity data and genome-wide DNAm profiles from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=785), we summarized DNAm variation of CpG sites in the promoters of genes regulating sensitive periods with the first two principal components (PCs). DNAm summaries were calculated for genes regulating sensitive period opening (ngenes=15), closing (ngenes=36), and expression/duration (ngenes=8). We then performed linear discriminant analysis to test associations between these DNAm summaries and the timing of exposure to seven types of adversity.

ResultsSexual or physical abuse and financial hardship during middle childhood (6-7 years) were associated with DNAm of genes regulating the onset and duration of sensitive periods. Sensitivity analyses assessing the presence of any exposure before age 7 and a composite measure of adversity yielded fewer signals, highlighting the importance of accounting for timing and adversity type.

ConclusionsWith our novel gene set-based approach, we have uncovered suggestive evidence that epigenetic regulation of developmental plasticity may be affected by early life adversity. The complementarity of our gene-level view of the epigenome to the more common and granular epigenome-wide association study may yield novel mechanistic insights not only for adversity but also for other exposures and outcomes.",NA,medrxiv

Those with borderline or intermediate risk require additional risk enhancing factors to guide preventive therapy decisions. Including a polygenic risk score (PRS) for coronary artery disease as a risk enhancing factor improves precision in determining the risk of ASCVD and informs decisions for prevention therapy.

ObjectiveTo assess the cost-effectiveness of integrating PRS for coronary artery disease with the PCE to determine an individuals 10-year risk for ASCVD compared to the PCE-alone.

Design, setting, and populationA Markov model was developed on a hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old individuals in the US with borderline or intermediate PCE 10-year risk for ASCVD who fall in the top quintile of the PRS distribution and are not on preventive therapy (e.g., statins). Model transition probabilities and economic costs came from existing literature with costs reflecting a payer perspective and inflation-adjusted to 2019 US$.

InterventionsThe modeled strategies were: (1) the PCE-alone and (2) the PCE with PRS for coronary artery disease as a risk enhancing factor. Analyses were performed at 5 year, 10 year, and lifetime time horizons.

Main outcomes and measuresQuality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, acute coronary syndromes and ischemic stroke events prevented, mean costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were measured. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess uncertainty in parameter estimates. Future costs and health benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3%.

ResultsCompared to the PCE-alone, PCE+PRS was cost-saving, effective and cost-effective (dominant). A health system would save more than $500, $2,300, and $9,000 per additional high-risk individual identified using PCE+PRS and prevent 27, 47 and 83 acute CAD or ischemic stroke events per 1,000 persons in 5 year, 10 year, and lifetime time horizons, respectively.

Conclusions and relevanceImplementing PRS as a risk enhancing factor for CAD among individuals with borderline or intermediate 10-year risk reclassifies individuals as high-risk who would otherwise remain unidentified, prevents future acute CAD and ischemic stroke events, and both saves money and is cost-effective for health systems.

Here, we employ an unprecedented multi-omics analysis, combined with artificial intelligence, in a young patient cohort where major co-morbidities have been excluded at the onset. Here, we established a three-tier cohort of individuals younger than 50 years without major comorbidities. These included 47 ""critical"" (in the ICU under mechanical ventilation) and 25 ""non-critical"" (in a noncritical care ward) COVID-19 patients as well as 22 healthy individuals. The analyses included whole-genome sequencing, whole-blood RNA sequencing, plasma and blood mononuclear cells proteomics, cytokine profiling and high-throughput immunophenotyping. An ensemble of machine learning, deep learning, quantum annealing and structural causal modeling led to key findings. Critical patients were characterized by exacerbated inflammation, perturbed lymphoid/myeloid compartments, coagulation and viral cell biology. Within a unique gene signature that differentiated critical from noncritical patients, several driver genes promoted severe COVID-19 among which the upregulated metalloprotease ADAM9 was key. This gene signature was replicated in an independent cohort of 81 critical and 73 recovered COVID-19 patients, as were ADAM9 transcripts, soluble form and proteolytic activity. Ex vivo ADAM9 inhibition affected SARS-CoV-2 uptake and replication in human lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, within a young, otherwise healthy, COVID-19 cohort, we provide the landscape of biological perturbations in vivo where a unique gene signature differentiated critical from non-critical patients. The key driver, ADAM9, interfered with SARS-CoV-2 biology. A repositioning strategy for anti-ADAM9 therapeutic is feasible.

The positive predictive value (PPV) of two APOCT used in the asymptomatic screening of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers (HCW) at continuing care (CC) sites across Alberta, Canada was evaluated.

METHODSBetween February 22 and May 2, 2021, CC sites implemented SARS-CoV-2 voluntary screening of their asymptomatic HCW. Onsite testing with Abbott Panbio or BD Veritor occurred on a weekly or twice weekly basis. Positive APOCT were confirmed with a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) reference method.

RESULTSA total of 71,847 APOCT (17,689 Veritor and 54,158 Panbio) were performed among 369 CC sites. Eighty-seven (0.12%) APOCT were positive, of which 39 (0.05%) confirmed as true positives using rRT-PCR.

By integrating diverse Klebsiella genomes with known CRE phenotypes, we successfully identified a synchronized presence of CRE phenotype-related genes in plasmids and chromosomes in comparison to strains with carbapenem susceptible phenotypes. The data revealed a major contribution to CRE comes from the combined effect of chromosome and plasmid genes potentiated by modifications of outer membrane porins. Our computational workflow identified key gene contributors to the non-CP CRE phenotype, including those that lead to an increase of antibiotic expulsion by enhanced efflux pump activity and mobile elements that reduce antibiotic intake, such as IS1 and Tn3-like elements. These findings are consistent with a new model wherein a change to the balance in drug influx and efflux potentiates the ability of some beta-lactamases to enable survival in the presence of carbapenems. Analysis of the large numbers of documented CRE infections, as well as forensic analysis of a case study, showed that this potentiation can occur in short timeframes to deliver a non-CP CRE infection. Our results suggest that the multiple genes that function to build an AMR phenotype can be diagnosed, so that strains that will resist treatment with carbapenem treatment will be evident if a comprehensive genome-based diagnostic for CRE considers all of these sequence-accessible features.

SIGNIFICANCECarbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has emerged as an important challenge in health-care settings, with Klebsiella pneumoniae playing a major role in the global burden of CRE infections. Through systematic characterisation of the chromosome and plasmid genes of K. pneumoniae strains and their antimicrobial traits we identified new CRE mechanisms that are important for accurate diagnosis of carbapenem-resistant AMR. The development of comprehensive genomics-based diagnostics for CRE will need to consider the multiple gene signatures that impact together to deliver non-carbapenemase, carbapenem-resistant infections.",NA,medrxiv

We sought to describe the rapid expansion of the Delta lineage in Ontario, Canada (population 15 million) using mutation profile information and confirmatory whole genome sequencing.

MethodsAll laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to Public Health Ontario between April 1st and June 12th 2021, with cycle threshold values [&le;]35, were eligible for screening for the N501Y and the E484K mutations. We classified cases via mutation screening as: (1) N501Y-/E484K- (wild-type/Delta), (2) Alpha (N501Y+/E484K-), (3) Beta/Gamma (N501Y+/E484K+), or (4) N501Y-/E484K+ (predominantly B.1.525, and B.1.1.318).

ResultsThe N501Y-/E484K- mutation profile went from having a 29% transmission deficit relative to Alpha (relative Re = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.77) on April 1st to having a 50% transmission advantage on June 12th (relative Re = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71). Whole genome sequencing of N501Y-/E484K-cases (N=583) confirmed that the pattern of increasing relative reproduction number coincided with the replacement of wild-type with Delta variant (from 2.2% in early April, to 83% in late May).

DiscussionDelta is rapidly overtaking other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ontario, and has a substantial transmission advantage. An inflection in the proportion of cases missing the N501Y mutation from rapidly decreasing to rapidly increasing,3 may be an early warning signal for Delta lineage expansion.",NA,medrxiv

Here, we aimed to investigate the size and composition of TB-derived urine cfDNA with minimal bias using next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS). To enable analysis of highly fragmented urine cfDNA, we used a combination of DNA extraction (Q sepharose) and single-stranded sequence library preparation methods demonstrated to recover short, highly degraded cfDNA fragments. We examined urine cfDNA from ten HIV-positive patients with confirmed pulmonary TB (nine of which had TB cfDNA detectable by qPCR) and two TB-negative controls. TB-derived cfDNA was identifiable by NGS from all TB-positive patients. TB urine cfDNA was significantly shorter than human urine cfDNA, with median fragment lengths of [&le;]19-52 bp and 42-92 bp, respectively. TB cfDNA abundance increased exponentially with decreased fragment length, with a peak fragment length of [&le;]19 bp in most samples. Our methodology also revealed a larger fraction of short human genomic cfDNA than previously reported, with peak fragment lengths of 29-53 bp. Urine cfDNA fragments spanned the TB genome with relative uniformity, but nucleic acids derived from multicopy elements were proportionately overrepresented, providing regions of inherent signal amplification beneficial for molecular diagnosis. This study demonstrates the potential of urine cfDNA as a diagnostic biomarker for TB and will inform improved design of TB urine cfDNA assays. Methods capable of targeting the shortest cfDNA fragments possible will be critical to maximize TB urine cfDNA detection sensitivity.",NA,medrxiv

Theoretical analysis and simulations show clearly as a voluntary vaccination can certainly reduce the impact of the disease but it is unable to eliminate it. We also show how the information-related parameters affect the dynamics of the disease.

Despite various vaccines of COVID-19 protect million people in many countries, the worldwide situations of more the asymptomatic and mutated strain discovered are urging the more sensitive COVID-19 testing in this turnaround time. Unfortunately, it is still nontrivial to develop a new fast COVID-19 screening method with the easier access and lower cost, due to the technical and cost limitations of the current testing methods in the medical resource-poor districts. On the other hand, there are more and more ocular manifestations that have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence[1]. This inspired this project. We have conducted the joint clinical research since January 2021 at the ShiJiaZhuang City, Hebei province, China, which approved by the ethics committee of The fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University. We undertake several blind tests of COVID-19 patients by Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Meantime as an important part of the ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020, we propose a new fast screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. This could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with the sustainable stable high performance in different countries and races. For this clinical trial in ShiJiaZhuang, we compare and analyze 1194 eye-region images of 115 patients, including 66 COVID-19 positive patients, 44 rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), 5 liver patients, as well as 117 healthy people. Remarkably, we consistently achieved very high testing results (> 0.94) in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our blind test of COVID-19 patients. This confirms the viability of the COVID-19 fast screening by the eye-region manifestations. Particularly and impressively, the results have the similar conclusion as the other clinical trials of the globally COVID-19 eye test program[1]. Hopefully, this series of ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test study, and potential rapid solution of fully self-performed COVID risk screening method, can be inspiring and helpful to more researchers in the world soon. Our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully self-performed, non-invasive, importantly real-time, and thus enables the continuous health surveillance. We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Our pilot experiments show that our model is ready to be usable to all kinds of surveillance scenarios, such as infrared temperature measurement device at airports and stations, or directly pushing to the target people groups smartphones as a packaged application.",NA,medrxiv

Here we address whether APC plays a role in T lymphocyte migration, a key step of anti-tumor immune responses.

Using a series of cell biology tools, we measured migration of primary T cells obtained from FAP patients carrying APC mutations. FAP T cells showed decreased chemotaxis through micropores or endothelial cell monolayers. Concomitantly, they presented lower expression of the VLA-4 (4{beta}1) integrin at the cell surface. Notably, adhesion and migration in micro-fabricated channels were specifically reduced when surfaces were coated with VLA-4 ligands, indicating that defective adhesion could lead to decreased T cell migration.

We found that APC is critical for VLA-4-dependent adhesion, and acto-myosin and microtubule organization in migrating cells. APC-silenced CEM cells preferentially adopt an ameboid-like migration, lacking adhesive filopodia and continuously extending and retracting unstructured membrane protrusions.

These findings underscore a role of APC in T cell migration via modulation of integrin-dependent adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization.

This paper studies the utility of these indicators from a forecasting perspective. We focus on five indicators, derived from medical insurance claims data, web search queries, and online survey responses. For each indicator, we ask whether its inclusion in a simple model leads to improved predictive accuracy relative to a similar model excluding it. We consider both probabilistic forecasting of confirmed COVID-19 case rates and binary prediction of case ""hotspots"". Since the values of indicators (and case rates) are commonly revised over time, we take special care to ensure that the data provided to a forecaster is the version that would have been available at the time the forecast was made. Our analysis shows that consistent but modest gains in predictive accuracy are obtained by using these indicators, and furthermore, these gains are related to periods in which the auxiliary indicators behave as ""leading indicators"" of case rates.",NA,medrxiv

MethodologyWe analyzed data of confirmed SARS-COV2 infection cases where symptoms began between February 22th, 2020, and March 31, 2021, as published by the General Epidemiology Direction (DGE) of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We calculated COVID-19 incidence and mortality by age group with population data from the Statistics and Population National Institute (INEGI), estimating the correlation between risk of death and the presence of comorbidities.

ResultsMortality in SARS-COV2 infected people varied considerably, between 7 to 155 deaths per million per year in the under-20 age groups compared to 441 to 15929 in the older age groups.

To select variables, a Ridge model was used. Optimal cut-off points were selected to maximize specificity setting a high sensitivity (80%). Weights of each variable were calculated with a multivariable logistic regression. The score was validated with the rest of the participants.

ResultsIn total, 262 (53%) children (median age, 2 years, 52.3% male) had an etiological diagnosis.

The step 1 discriminates viral from bacterial CAP. Bacterial CAPs were classified with a sensitivity=97%, a specificity=48%, and a ROCs area under the curve (AUC)=0.81. If a CAP was classificated as bacterial, it was assessed with step 2. The step 2 differentiates typical vs. atypical bacterial CAP. Typical bacteria were classified with a sensitivity=100%, a specificity=64%, and AUC=0.90.

ConclusionThis two-steps tool can facilitate the physicians decision to prescribe antibiotics without compromising patient safety.

Article summaryWe validated a clinical tool to predict the aetiology of CAP in children safely. This tool differentiates CAP into viral, atypical bacteria and typical bacteria.

""Whats Known on This Subject""Establishing the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children at admission is challenging. As a result, most admitted children with CAP receive antibiotics.

""What This Study Adds""We validated a clinical tool to predict the aetiology of pneumonia in children safely, differentiating among viral, atypical bacteria and typical bacteria.",NA,medrxiv

The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is mitigated by several non-pharmaceutical interventions, but it is hard to predict which of these regulations are the most effective for a given population.

MethodsWe developed a computationally effective and scalable, agent-based microsimulation framework. This unified framework was fitted to realistic data to enable us to test control measures (closures, quarantining, testing, vaccination) in multiple infection waves caused by the spread of a new virus variant in a city-sized societal environment. Our framework is capable of simulating nine billion agent-steps per minute, allowing us to model interactions in populations with up to 90 million individuals.

FindingsWe show that vaccination strategies prioritising occupational risk groups minimise the number of infections but allow higher mortality while prioritising vulnerable groups minimises mortality but implies increased infection rate. We also found that intensive vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially suppress the spread of the virus, while low levels of vaccination and premature reopening may easily revert the epidemic to an uncontrolled state.

InterpretationOur analysis highlights that while vaccination protects the elderly from COVID-19, a large percentage of children will contract and spread the virus, and we also show the benefits and limitations of various quarantine and testing scenarios.

FundingThis work was carried out within the framework of the Hungarian National Development, Research, and Innovation (NKFIH) Fund 2020-2.1.1-ED-2020-00003.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe still do not have an effective medical treatment against COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), thus the majority of the efforts to stop the pandemic focuses on non-pharmaceutical interventions. Each country came up with a local solution to stop the spread of the virus by increased testing, quarantining, lock-down of various events and institutions or early vaccination. There is no clear way how these interventions can be compared, and it is especially challenging to predict how combinations of interventions could influence the pandemic. Various mathematical modelling approaches helped decision-makers to foresee the effects of their decisions. Most of these models rely on classical, deterministic compartmental ""SEIR"" models, which can be solved easily but cannot take into account spatial effects and most non-pharmaceutical interventions affect the same parameters, so there is no way to analyse their separate or joint effects. Agent-based microsimulations are harder to solve but can consider far more details. Several models were developed on these lines focusing on questions about ideal vaccination, lock-down or other specific problems, but none of these studies evaluated and compared the individual and mixed effects of a wide variety of control measures.

Added-value of this studyHere we present PanSim, a framework where we introduce a detailed infection event simulation step and the possibility to control specific workplaces individually (schools, hospitals, etc.), test various vaccination, testing and quarantine scenarios while considering preconditions, age, sex, residence and workplace of individuals and mutant viruses with various infectivity. The level of details and granularity of simulations allow our work to evaluate this wide range of scenarios and control measures accurately and directly compare them with one another to provide quantitative evidence to support decision-makers. Analysis of our simulations also provides emergent results on the risks children and non-vaccinated individuals face.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe agent-based microsimulation framework allows us to evaluate the risk and possible consequences of particular interventions precisely. Due to the outstanding efficiency of the computations, it is possible to apply scenario-based analysis and control design methods which require a high number of simulation runs to obtain results on a given confidence level. This will enable us to design and quantitatively assess control measures in case of new waves of COVID-19 or new pandemic outbreaks.",NA,medrxiv

MethodThe study was a qualitative study design guided by systemic intervention methodology. Qualitative data were collected through key informant interviews (n=63) and focus group discussions (n= 12), and case study-based thematic analysis was carried out. Causal loop diagram was utilised to illustrate the dynamic interactions of the social determinants based on the themes. The study also involved sense-making sessions with policy level and local stakeholders.

FindingsFour key interacting themes emerged from the study. Dietary and physical activity practices have shifted significantly at community level contributing to increased risk of NCDs. The practice of healthy and locally produced meals was gradually being displaced by junk food and linked to junk food availability and declining agricultural activities. Health system was ineffective in preventing unhealthy practices. Gender and social economic factors were driving the poor dietary practices and physical inactivity.

ConclusionWhile the current dietary and physical activity-related practices within communities were poor, the broader determinants such as socio-economic circumstances and gender further fuelled such practices. The health system has potential to play an effective role in the prevention of the behavioural and social determinants of NCDs.",NA,medrxiv

Telemedicine is increasingly facilitating access to healthcare, in LMICs. This prospective cohort intervention study aims to investigate feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation to provide long-term follow-up of individuals with SCI and ABI, in Nepal, post-discharge from hospital.

MethodsTERN was delivered by Spinal Injury Rehabilitation Centre, Nepal, in collaboration with University of Leeds, UK. A home visit connected participants to the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT), through a specialised video conference system. The MDT performed a comprehensive assessment before recommending personalised interventions. Outcome measures assessed functional independence in performing activities of daily living, health-related quality of life and emotional disturbances using Modified Barthel Index, EuroQoL-5D, and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, respectively. A subset of participants was interviewed, exploring acceptability of telerehabilitation.

FindingsBetween January and December 2020, 97 participants with SCI (n = 82) and ABI (n = 15) were enrolled. After receiving telerehabilitation, significant improvement to self-reported functional independence (p<.001) and quality of life were found, (p<.001). Self-reported severity of depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased (p<.001). Qualitative interviews (n = 18) revealed participants accepted telerehabilitation, they valued regular contact with professionals without costly, difficult travel.

InterpretationThis is the first study to test telerehabilitation in Nepal.

Children with ASD exhibit behavioral and social impairments, giving rise to the possibility of utilizing computational techniques to evaluate a childs social phenotype from home videos.

MethodsHere, we use a mobile health application to collect over 11 hours of video footage depicting 95 children engaged in gameplay in a natural home environment. We utilize automated dataset annotations to analyze two social indicators that have previously been shown to differ between children with ASD and their neurotypical (NT) peers: (1) gaze fixation patterns and (2) visual scanning methods. We compare the gaze fixation and visual scanning methods utilized by children during a 90-second gameplay video in order to identify statistically-significant differences between the two cohorts; we then train an LSTM neural network in order to determine if gaze indicators could be predictive of ASD.

ResultsOur work identifies one statistically significant region of fixation and one significant gaze transition pattern that differ between our two cohorts during gameplay. In addition, our deep learning model demonstrates mild predictive power in identifying ASD based on coarse annotations of gaze fixations.

DesignThe present study included 1210 participants from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study. We depicted the landscape of human gut antibiotic resistome with shotgun metagenomic data and examined its association with T2D and cardiometabolic traits. The co-occurrence network analysis was used to explore the associations between T2D-related ARGs and gut microbial species. We also examined the associations between gut antibiotic resistome features and fecal metabolome.

ResultsThere was a significant overall shift in gut antibiotic resistome structure among healthy, prediabetes and T2D groups (p = 0.004). We found that larger ARG diversity was associated with a higher risk of T2D (all p < 0.05). Based on the association found between resistomes and T2D, we developed diabetes ARG score and demonstrated its creative use as a new predictor for T2D progression manifested by the change of insulin resistance. Further network analysis showed the co-occurrence association between T2D-related ARGs and gut microbial species, which indicated the potential bacterial hosts of these ARG biomarkers. Resistome-metabolome co-analysis suggests a potential link of ARGs with fecal metabolites, which may reflect the host-microbial metabolic adaptation.

DesignCommunity-based prospective and longitudinal cohort study

SettingThe United Kingdom (UK) MS Register (UKMSR) COVID-19 study

ParticipantsA national cohort of people with MS and COVID-19

Main outcome measuresParticipants used the online questionnaire-based platform of the UKMSR to update their COVID-19 symptoms, recovery status, and duration of symptoms for those who had fully recovered. Questionnaires were date-stamped for estimation of COVID-19 symptom duration for those who had not recovered at their last follow-up. The UKMSR holds demographic and up-to-date clinical data on participants as well as their web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale (a measure of physical disability in MS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores. The association between these factors and recovery from COVID-19 was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis.

ResultsOut of 7,977 people with MS who participated in the UKMSR COVID-19 study, 599 had COVID-19 and updated their recovery status prospectively. At least 181 participants (31.1%) had long-standing COVID-19 symptoms for [&ge;]4 weeks and 76 (13.1 %) for [&ge;]12 weeks. Participants with higher levels of pre-COVID-19 physical disability, participants with anxiety and/or depression prior to COVID-19 onset, and women were less likely to report recovery from COVID-19.

ConclusionsLong COVID appears to disproportionately affect people with pre-existing mental health problems or physical disabilities. As post-COVID-19 rehabilitation services are being developed, individualised pathways should be considered to accommodate the needs of these vulnerable populations.

Over a period of 7 weeks from early February through late March 2021, wastewater originating from the residence hall was collected as grab samples 3 times per week. During this time, there was no detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in the residence hall wastewater stream. Aiming to obtain a sample more representative of the residence hall community, a decision was made to use passive samplers beginning in late March onwards. Adopting a Moore Swab approach, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewater samples on just two days after passive samplers were activated. These samples were also positive for the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) Variant of Concern (VOC) by RT-qPCR. The positive result triggered a public health case finding response including a mobile testing unit deployed to the residence hall the following day with testing of nearly 200 students and staff, which identified two laboratory-confirmed cases of B.1.1.7 variant COVID-19.

Metacognition, an individuals ability to reflect on and monitor cognitive processes, is likely to be relevant. Local metacognition refers to an ability to estimate confidence in cognitive performance on a moment-to-moment basis, whereas global metacognition refers to long-run self-evaluations of overall performance. Using a novel protocol comprising task-based measures and hierarchical Bayesian modelling, we compared local and global metacognitive performance in individuals with FCD and evaluated interactions between these levels of metacognition. We also investigated how local and global metacognition were related to the presence of affective symptomatology.

Eighteen participants with FCD were recruited to this cross-sectional study. Participants completed computerised tasks that enabled local metacognitive efficiency for perception and memory to be measured using the hierarchical meta-d (HMeta-d) model within a signal detection theory framework. Participants also completed the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) measuring global metacognition (beliefs about memory performance), and questionnaires measuring anxiety and depression. Estimates of local metacognitive efficiency were compared to those estimated from two control groups who had undergone comparable metacognitive tasks. Global metacognition scores were compared to existing normative data. A hierarchical regression model was used to evaluate associations between global metacognition, depression and anxiety and local metacognitive efficiency, while simple linear regressions were used to evaluate whether affective symptomatology and local metacognitive confidence were associated with global metacognition.

Participants with FCD had intact local metacognition for perception and memory when compared to controls, with the 95% highest-density intervals for metacognitive efficiency overlapping with the two control groups in both cognitive domains. FCD participants had significantly lower global metacognition scores compared to normative data; MMQ-Ability (t=6.54, p<0.0001) and MMQ-Satisfaction (t=5.04, p<0.0001). Mood scores, global metacognitive measures and metacognitive bias were not significantly associated with local metacognitive efficiency. Increased local metacognitive bias ({beta}= -0.20 (SE=0.09), q= 0.01) and higher depression scores as measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ({beta}= -1.40 (SE=2.56), q= 0.01) were associated with lower global metacognition scores.

We show that local metacognition is intact, whilst global metacognition is impaired, in FCD, suggesting a decoupling between the two metacognitive processes. In a Bayesian model, an aberrant prior (impaired global metacognition), may override bottom up sensory input (intact local metacognition), giving rise to the subjective experience of abnormal cognitive processing. Future work should further investigate the interplay between local and global metacognition in FCD and aim to identify a therapeutic target to recouple these processes.",NA,medrxiv

Therefore, it has been an open question which features allow reliable discrimination between male and female fundus images. To study this question, we used a particular DNN architecture called BagNet, which extracts local features from small image patches and then averages the class evidence across all patches. The BagNet performed on par with the more sophisticated Inception-v3 model, showing that the gender information can be read out from local features alone. BagNets also naturally provide saliency maps, which we used to highlight the most informative patches in fundus images. We found that most evidence was provided by patches from the optic disc and the macula, with patches from the optic disc providing mostly male and patches from the macula providing mostly female evidence. Although further research is needed to clarify the exact nature of this evidence, our results suggest that there are localized structural differences in fundus images between genders. Overall, we believe that BagNets may provide a compelling alternative to the standard DNN architectures also in other medical image analysis tasks, as they do not require post-hoc explainability methods.",NA,medrxiv

Results1,109 cases (55%) received a molecular diagnosis, of which one fifth have potential disease-modifying treatments (236/1,109, 21%). Functional studies enabled diagnostic uplift from 36% to 55% and discovery of 62 novel disease genes. Pathogenic variants were identified within genes encoding mitochondrial proteins or RNAs in 801 cases (72%), while, given extensive phenotype overlap, the remainder involved proteins targeted to other cellular compartments. To delineate genotype-phenotype associations, our data was complemented with registry and literature data to develop ""GENOMITexplorer"", an open access resource detailing patient- (n=3,940), gene- (n=427), and variant-level (n=1,492) associations (prokischlab.github.io/GENOMITexplorer/).

ConclusionsReaching a molecular diagnosis was essential for implementation of precision medicine and clinical trial eligibility, underlining the need for genome-wide screening given inability to accurately define mitochondrial diseases clinically. Key to diagnostic success were functional studies, encouraging early acquisition of patient- derived tissues and routine integration of high-throughput functional data to improve patient care by uplifting diagnostic rate.",NA,medrxiv

We find robust evidence that the HSA improved the height and weight of children. In addition, we find evidence consistent with a channel that the policy improved the womens intrahousehold bargaining power within the household, leading to improved parental investments for children. These study findings are also compatible with the notion that children do better when their mothers control a more significant fraction of the family.

There is considerable pre-clinical evidence for potential synergy between PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade and the hypomethylating agents already commonly used for this disease. We report here the results of 17-H-0026 (PD-AML, NCT02996474), an investigator sponsored, single-institution, single-arm open-label ten-subject pilot study to test the feasibility of the first-in-human combination of pembrolizumab and decitabine in adult patients with refractory or relapsed AML (R-AML). In this cohort of previously treated patients, this novel combination of anti-PD-1 and hypomethylating therapy was feasible and associated with a best response of stable disease or better in 6 of 10 patients. Considerable immunological changes were identified using TCR{beta} sequencing as well as single-cell immunophenotypic and RNA expression analyses on sorted CD3+ T cells in patients who developed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) during treatment. Clonal T cell expansions occurred at irAE onset; single-cell sequencing demonstrated that these expanded clones were predominately CD8+ effector memory T cells with high cell surface PD-1 expression and transcriptional profiles indicative of activation and cytotoxicity. In contrast, no such distinctive immune changes were detectable in those experiencing a measurable anti-leukemic response during treatment. Addition of pembrolizumab to ten-day decitabine therapy was clinically feasible in patients with R-AML, with immunological changes from PD-1 blockade observed in patients experiencing irAEs.

We aim to provide updated estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence.

MethodsTwo community-based HIV/hepatitis C programs on active PWID were implemented in 2012-2013 (ARISTOTLE, N=3,320) and 2018-2020 (ARISTOTLE HCV-HIV, N=1,635) through consecutive respondent-driven sampling recruitment rounds. PWID were uniquely identified across rounds/programs. We evaluated trends in HIV prevalence, socioeconomic characteristics, and injection practices in PWID participating in both periods and estimated HIV incidence in a cohort of seronegative PWID. Molecular sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in HIV seroconverters.

ResultsHIV prevalence (95% CI) increased from 14.2% (11.7%-17.1%) in 2012-2013 to 22.0% (19.0%-25.3%) in 2018-2020 (p<0.001). There was a deterioration of socioeconomic characteristics such as homelessness (from 16.2% to 25.6%, p<0.001), a shift in the use of cocaine (from 16.6% to 28.1%, p<0.001), reduced access to free syringes (past 12 months: 51.8% and 45.1%, p=0.005) and to HIV testing (past 12 months: 50.9% and 49.4%). HIV incidence (95% CI) in 2014-2015, 2016-2017 and 2018-February 2020 was 2.10 (1.41-3.14), 2.04 (1.34-3.10) and 1.52 (0.84-2.75) new cases/100 person-years, respectively. Younger age, lower educational level, larger injection network and daily injecting were risk factors for HIV seroconversion. Almost 9% of HIV seroconversions occurred within a newly expanding phylogenetic cluster.

ConclusionThe ongoing HIV transmission among PWID in Athens provides empirical evidence that the current levels of prevention and treatment are inadequate to control the epidemic, leading to expansion of the pool of infected PWID and a rise in HIV prevalence. Re-evaluation of prevention and treatment programs is urgently needed.

Treatment consists of oral antibiotics. Fidaxomicin, bezlotoxumab and fecal microbiota transplantion (FMT) reduce the number of recurrences compared to vancomycin, but are more costly. Identifying patients diagnosed with initial CDI who are at increased risk of developing sCDI/rCDI could lead to more cost-effective therapeutic choices.

ObjectivesIn this systematic review we aimed to identify clinical prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of developing sCDI or rCDI.

MethodsPubMed, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science and COCHRANE Library databases were searched from database inception through March, 2021. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers on the basis of predefined selection criteria; conflicts were resolved by consensus. Cohort and case-control studies providing an analysis of clinical or laboratory data to predict sCDI/rCDI in patients [&ge;]18 years diagnosed with CDI, were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Quality in Prognostic Research (QUIPS) tool and the quality of evidence by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool, modified for prognostic studies. Overview tables of prognostic factors were constructed to assess the number of studies and the respective direction of an association (positive, negative, or no association).

Results and conclusions136 studies were included for final analysis. Higher age and the presence of multiple comorbidities were prognostic factors for sCDI. Identified risk factors for rCDI were higher age, healthcare-associated CDI, prior hospitalization, PPIs started during/after CDI diagnosis and previous rCDI. Some variables that were found as risk factors for sCDI/rCDI in previous reviews were not confirmed in the current review, which can be attributed to differences in methodology. Risk stratification for sCDI/rCDI may contribute to a more personalized and optimal treatment for patients with CDI.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsThe study used a prospective cohort design of all pregnant women with suspected COVID-19. Subjects were divided into COVID-19 and non COVID-19 group based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of SARS-CoV-2. The clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and pregnancy outcomes were then compared between both groups.

ResultsFrom 141 suspected maternal cases, 62 COVID-19 cases were confirmed (43.9%), while 79 suspected cases were found to be negative (56.1%). The clinical manifestations and laboratory findings between the two groups were not significantly different (p>0.05). However, the maternal mortality directly caused by COVID-19 was significantly higher compared to the non-COVID-19 group (8.3 vs 1.3%; p=0.044; OR 6.91, 95% CI: 0.79-60.81).

Aiming to represent the quantities that characterize the epidemic behaviour from an accurate fit to the observed data, we partition the observation time interval into sub-intervals. The model parameters change according to a switching rule depending on the data behaviour and the infection rate continuity condition. In particular, we study the representation of the infection rate both as linear and exponential piecewise continuous functions. We choose the length of sub-intervals balancing the data fit with the model complexity through the Bayesian Information Criterion. The calibration of the model shows an excellent representation of the epidemic behaviour and thirty days forecasts have proven to reproduce the infection spread reliably.

A smartphone-based software can automate interpretation of an LFA kit, but such algorithms typically require a very large number of images of assays tested with validated specimens, which is challenging to collect for different assay kits, especially for those released during a pandemic. Here, we present an approach - AutoAdapt LFA - that uses few-shot learning, an approach used in other applications such as computer vision and robotics, for accurate and automated interpretation of LFA kits that requires a small number of validated images for training. The approach consists of three components: extraction of membrane and zone areas from an image of the LFA kit, a self-supervised encoder that employs a feature extractor trained with edge-filtered patterns, and few-shot adaptation that enables generalization to new kits using limited validated images. From a base model pre-trained on a commercial LFA kit, we demonstrated the ability of adapted models to interpret results from five new COVID-19 LFA kits (three detecting antigens for diagnosing active infection, and two detecting antibodies for diagnosing past infection). Specifically, using just 10 to 20 images of each new kit, we achieved accuracies of 99% to 100% for each kit. The server-hosted algorithm has an execution time of approximately 4 seconds, which can potentially enable quality assurance and linkage to care for users operating new LFAs in decentralized settings.",NA,medrxiv

However, supply chain logistics have hampered global vaccine delivery, which is impacting mass vaccination strategies. Recent studies have identified different strategies for vaccine dose administration so that supply constraints issues are diminished. These include increasing the time between consecutive doses in a two-dose vaccine regimen and reducing the dosage of the second dose. We consider both of these strategies in a mathematical modeling study of a non-replicating viral vector adenovirus vaccine in this work. We investigate the impact of different prime-boost strategies by quantifying their effects on immunological outcomes based on simple ordinary differential equations. The boost dose is administered either at a standard dose (SD) of 1000 or at a low dose (LD) of 500 or 250 vaccine particles. Simulated Second dose fractionation highlights previously shown dose-dependent features of the immune mechanism. In agreement with clinical characteristics of 175 COVID-19 recovered patients, the model predictions for either SD/SD or SD/LD regimens mainly show that by stretching the prime-boost interval until 18 or 20 weeks, the minimum promoted antibody (Nab) response is comparable with the neutralizing antibody level of COVID-19 recovered patients. The minimum stimulated antibody in SD/SD regimen is identical with the high level of clinical trial data. It is at the same range of the medium-high level of Nab in SD/LD, where the second dose is half or quarter of the standard dose.",NA,medrxiv

The lower numbers of cases and deaths in Uganda might be due to pre-existing cross-immunity induced by zoonotic coronaviruses or circulating common cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to test this premise, we compared IgA reactivity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HCoVs in breast milk of US and rural Ugandan mothers collected in 2018 before the COVID-19 epidemic. Ugandan and US pre-pandemic breast milk samples were run in duplicate on enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) to measure specific IgA antibody reactivity to the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E. Pooled plasma from US COVID-19 positive and negative cases were employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. One Ugandan pre-pandemic milk sample had remarkably high reactivity against all HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. There was higher IgA reactivity against the betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 in Ugandan pre-pandemic milk samples by comparison with US pre-pandemic milk samples (p = 0.018). By contrast, there was significantly higher IgA reactivity against the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in US pre-pandemic milk samples by comparison with Ugandan pre-pandemic milk samples (p < 0.0001 and 0.035, respectively).

ConclusionSome Ugandan mothers may have robust pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 due to cross-immunity induced by HCoVs which may be passed on to their infants via breastfeeding. The differential pre-pandemic reactivity of US mothers to HCoV 229E and HCoV NL63 may have contributed to suboptimal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.",NA,medrxiv

Whether lasting differences exist between infection and vaccination boosted immunity is yet to be known. The answer to this question will determine key issues such as the reliability of individual and herd immunity or the need of sanitary restrictions or periodical revaccination. The aim of this study was to determine how long total anti SARS-CoV2 antibodies due to past infection persist in peripheral blood and whether sex, age or haematological features can influence their lasting.

Material and MethodsA total of 2432 donations SARS-CoV-2 from 662 repeat donors from April 2020 to February 2021 were analysed. Donors were 69.7% males and their average age was 46. An automated chemilumiscence immunoassay for total antibodies recognizing N protein of SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma was performed.

Results and discussionIn 97.6% donors with follow-up, anti SARS-CoV-2 protein N total antibodies remained positive up to 46 weeks after first positive determination. Blood group was not related to antibody waning. Lower lymphocyte counts and higher neutrophils and as well higher seric IgA would help predict future negativization of antibodies. The vast majority of donors keep their total immunoglobulins anti SARS-CoV-2 positive for longer than 10 months. Ageing might have a protective effect against antibody waning but, given the small number of cases that become negative, more studies, or larger cohorts would be needed to confirm these facts.",NA,medrxiv

However, there is a dearth of data on the success of such advanced levels of care outside the ICU setting. Therefore, we conducted an observational study at our centre, and systematically reviewed the literature, to assess the success of HFNC in managing severe COVID-19 cases outside the ICU.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral centre where records of all adult COVID-19 patients ([&ge;]18 years) requiring HFNC support were between September and December 2020 were analysed. HFNC support was adjusted to target SpO2 [&ge;]90% and respiratory rate [&le;]30 per min. The clinical, demographic, laboratory, and treatment details of these patients were retrieved from the medical records and entered in pre-designed proforma. Outcome parameters included duration of oxygen during hospital stay, duration of HFNC therapy, length of hospital stay and death or discharge. HFNC success was denoted when a patient did not require escalation of therapy to NIV or invasive mechanical ventilation, or shifting to the ICU, and was eventually discharged from the hospital without oxygen therapy; otherwise, the outcome was denoted as HFNC failure. Systematic review was also performed on the available literature on the experience with HFNC in COVID-19 patients outside of ICU settings using the MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase databases. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of STATA software, version 12, OpenMeta[Analyst], and visualization of the risk of bias plot using robvis.

ResultsThirty-one patients receiving HFNC in the ward setting, had a median age of 62 (50 - 69) years including 24 (77%) males. Twenty-one (68%) patients successfully tolerated HFNC and were subsequently discharged from the wards, while 10 (32%) patients had to be shifted to ICU for non-invasive or invasive ventilation, implying HFNC failure. Patients with HFNC failure had higher median D-dimer values at baseline (2.2 mcg/ml vs 0.6 mcg/ml, p=0.001) and lower initial SpO2 on room air at admission (70% vs 80%, p=0.026) as compared to those in whom HFNC was successful .A cut-off value of 1.7 mg/L carried a high specificity (90.5%) and moderate sensitivity (80%) for the occurrence of HFNC failure. Radiographic severity scoring as per the BRIXIA score was comparable in both the groups(11 vs 10.5 out of 18, p=0.78). After screening 98 articles, total of seven studies were included for synthesis in the systematic review with a total of 820 patients, with mean age of the studies ranging from 44 to 83 years and including 62% males. After excluding 2 studies from the analysis, the pooled rates of HFNC failure were 36.3% (95% CI 31.1% - 41.5%) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 =0%, p=0.55).

ConclusionsOur study demonstrated successful outcomes with use of HFNC in an outside of ICU setting among two-thirds of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Lower room air SpO2 and higher D-dimer levels at presentation were associated with failure of HFNC therapy leading to ICU transfer for endotracheal intubation or death. Also, the results from the systematic review demonstrated similar rates of successful outcomes concluding that HFNC is a viable option with failure rates similar to those of ICU settings in such patients.",NA,medrxiv

We conducted a prospective, longitudinal analysis in COVID-19 recovered patients at various time points over a 10-month period in order to determine how circulating antibody levels and interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) release by peripheral blood cells change over time following natural infection.

From March 2020 till January 2021, we enrolled 412 adults mostly with mild or moderate disease course. At each study visit, subjects donated peripheral blood for testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and IFN-{gamma} release after SARS-CoV-2 S-protein stimulation. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were identified in 316/412 (76.7%) of the patients and 215/412 (52.2%) had positive neutralizing antibody levels. Likewise, in 274/412 (66.5 %) positive IFN-{gamma} release and IgG antibodies were detected. With respect to time after infection, both IgG antibody levels and IFN-{gamma} concentrations decreased by about half within three hundred days. Statistically, IgG and IFN-{gamma} production were closely associated, but on an individual basis we observed patients with high antibody titres but low IFN-{gamma} levels and vice versa.

Our data suggest that immunological reaction is acquired in most individuals after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is sustained in the majority of patients for at least 10 months after infection. Since no robust marker for protection against COVID-19 exists so far, we recommend utilizing both, IgG and IFN-{gamma} release for an individual assessment of immunity status.",NA,medrxiv

However, prevalent antibiotic resistance of Propionibacterium acnes, along with the absence of clinically available resistance tests, has made macrolide misuse a frequent occurrence, with serious consequences.

ObjectiveWe developed P. acnes qPCR-based antibiotics resistance assay (ACQUIRE) to enable fast and accurate detection of P. acnes macrolide resistance in clinical settings, representing an opportunity to administer antibiotics more wisely and improve the quality of care.

MethodsA cross-sectional observational study was conducted to probe into the macrolide resistance of P. acnes in acne patients.

ResultsThe high sensitivity of ACQUIRE enabled us to reveal a much higher P. acnes 23S rDNA point mutation rate (52%) and thus a higher macrolide resistance (75.5%) compared to previous reports. Carriage of ermX gene was discovered on 472 (53%) subjects, which concurs with previous studies.

MethodsSamples: 6907 adults self-reporting COVID-19 infection from 48,901 participants in the UK LS, and 3,327 adults with COVID-19, were assigned a long COVID code from 1,199,812 individuals in primary care EHR. Outcomes for LS included symptom duration lasting 4+ weeks (long COVID) and 12+ weeks. Association with of age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, smoking, general and mental health, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and asthma was assessed.

ResultsIn LS, symptoms impacted normal functioning for 12+ weeks in 1.2% (mean age 20 years) to 4.8% (mean age 63 y) of COVID-19 cases. Between 7.8% (mean age 28 y) and 17% (mean age 58 y) reported any symptoms for 12+ weeks, and greater proportions for 4+ weeks. Age was associated with a linear increased risk in long COVID between 20 and 70 years.

The optimal procedures to prevent, identify, monitor, and treat these pulmonary sequelae are elusive.

Research questionTo characterize the kinetics of pulmonary recovery, risk factors and constellations of clinical features linked to persisting radiological lung findings after COVID-19.

Study design and methodsA longitudinal, prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study including COVID-19 patients (n = 108). Longitudinal pulmonary imaging and functional readouts, symptom prevalence, clinical and laboratory parameters were collected during acute COVID-19 and at 60-, 100- and 180-days follow-up visits. Recovery kinetics and risk factors were investigated by logistic regression. Classification of clinical features and study participants was accomplished by k-means clustering, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and naive Bayes algorithms.

ResultsAt the six-month follow-up, 51.9% of participants reported persistent symptoms with physical performance impairment (27.8%) and dyspnea (24.1%) being the most frequent. Structural lung abnormalities were still present in 45.4% of the collective, ranging from 12% in the outpatients to 78% in the subjects treated at the ICU during acute infection. The strongest risk factors of persisting lung findings were elevated interleukin-6 (IL6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) during recovery and hospitalization during acute COVID-19. Clustering analysis revealed association of the lung lesions with increased anti-S1/S2 antibody, IL6, CRP, and D-dimer levels at the early follow-up suggesting non-resolving inflammation as a mechanism of the perturbed recovery.

Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of risk class assignment and prediction of individual risk of delayed lung recovery employing clustering and machine learning algorithms.

InterpretationSeverity of acute infection, and systemic inflammation is strongly linked to persistent post-COVID-19 lung abnormality. Automated screening of multi-parameter health record data may assist the identification of patients at risk of delayed pulmonary recovery and optimize COVID-19 follow-up management.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in students and school staff; and to identify predictors of infection, including both municipal epidemiological indicators and individual variables reported by the participants.

MethodsThis was a virological survey carried out among students (over 14 years old) and school staff in Sao Paulo state, between epidemiological weeks 43 to 49 of the year 2020. A self-administrated questionnaire including sociodemographic and clinical information was applied. Moreover, a nasopharynx swab was performed for virological testing (RT-PCR). We evaluate the relationship of COVID-19 epidemiological indicators of the residence municipality with the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this, a composite index relating recent mortality and previous incidence (RM/PI) was proposed based on the ratio of deaths recorded in the second and third week counted back to the sum of cases during the previous seven weeks (weeks 4 to 10 counted back). We obtained a multiple model using random-effects logit regression integrating epidemiological indicators and individual variables.

ResultsIn total, 3436 participants were included, residents of 72 municipalities. The overall prevalence of infection was 1.7% (95%CI: 1.3%-2.2%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was independently associated with loss of smell, a history of pulmonary disease, and a recent trip outside the municipality. Moreover, the RM/PI index consistently predicted the SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted OR: 1.45; 95%CI 1.02-2.04). Based on these associations, we proposed a classification in four groups with different SARS-Cov-2 infection prevalence (0.54%, 1.27%, 3.8%, and 4.13%).

ConclusionEpidemiological and individual variables allowed classifying groups according to the infection probability in a school population of the state of Sao Paulo. This classification could help guide the return to classes in situations in which epidemiological control is evident, maintaining basic protection measures and increasing vaccination coverage.",NA,medrxiv

However, limited data exist on the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic from the first wave through the second wave in India. With detailed epidemiologic data, we aimed to assess trends in incident cases and case fatality, its risk between pandemic waves in Pune, an epicenter of COVID-19 cases in India, a country with the second-largest absolute burden worldwide.

MethodsProgrammatic COVID-19 data from Pune city between the first wave (March 09th 2020-October 31st, 2020), maintenance phase (November 01st 2020-February 14th, 2021), the second wave (February 15th, 2021-May 31st, 2021) were assessed for trends of incident cases, time-to-death, and case fatality rate (CFR). In addition, Poisson regression models adjusted for age and gender were used to determine the independent effect of pandemic waves on mortality.

ResultsOf 465,192 COVID-19 cases, 162,182 (35%) were reported in the first wave, and 4,146 (2.5%) died among them; Maintenance period registered 27,517 (6%) cases with 590 (2.1%) deaths; Second wave reported 275,493 (59%) cases and 3184 (1.1%) deaths (p<0.01). The overall CFR was 1.16 per 1000 person-days (PD), which declined from 1.80 per 1000 PD during the first wave to 0.77 per 1000 PD in the second wave. The risk of death was 1.49 times higher during the first wave (adjusted case fatality rate ratio-aCFRR,1.49; 95% CI: 1.37-1.62) and 35% lower in the second wave (aCFRR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.70), compared to the maintenance phase.

Model results represent an important part of the information base for the decision process on different administrative levels. The Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) initiated a project whose main goal is to predict COVID-19-specific occupation of beds in intensive care units: Steuerungs-Prognose von Intensivmedizinischen COVID-19 Kapazitaten (SPoCK). The incidence of COVID-19 cases is a crucial predictor for this occupation.

MethodsWe developed a model based on ordinary differential equations for the COVID-19 spread with a time-dependent infection rate described by a spline. Furthermore, the model explicitly accounts for weekday-specific reporting and adjusts for reporting delay. The model is calibrated in a purely data-driven manner by a maximum likelihood approach. Uncertainties are evaluated using the profile likelihood method. The uncertainty about the appropriate modeling assumptions can be accounted for by including and merging results of different modelling approaches.

ResultsThe model is calibrated based on incident cases on a daily basis and provides daily predictions of incident COVID-19 cases for the upcoming three weeks including uncertainty estimates for Germany and its subregions. Derived quantities such as cumulative counts and 7-day incidences with corresponding uncertainties can be computed. The estimation of the time-dependent infection rate leads to an estimated reproduction factor that is oscillating around one. Data-driven estimation of the dark figure purely from incident cases is not feasible.

ConclusionsWe successfully implemented a procedure to forecast near future COVID-19 incidences for diverse subregions in Germany which are made available to various decision makers via an interactive web application. Results of the incidence modeling are also used as a predictor for forecasting the need of intensive care units.",NA,medrxiv

This is the first German nationwide study to examine differences in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections according to SEP at the individual level.

MethodsThe  CORONA-MONITORING bundesweit (RKI-SOEP) study is a seroepidemiological survey among a dynamic cohort of the German adult population (n=15,122; October 2020 - February 2021). Dried blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and oral-nasal swabs for viral RNA. SEP was measured by education and income. Robust logistic regression was used to examine adjusted associations of SARS-CoV-2 infections with SEP.

Results288 participants were seropositive, PCR-positive, or self-reported a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adjusted odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 1.87-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06-3.29) higher among low-educated than highly educated adults. Evidence was weaker for income differences in infections (odds ratio=1.65; 95% CI=0.89-3.05). Highly educated adults had lower odds of undetected infection.

Data sourcesStudies in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Psycinfo, and medRxiv up to February 6, 2021.

Eligibility criteria and data analysisPrevalence rates of mental health symptoms in the general population and key sub-populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe. Data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression.

ResultsThe meta-analysis identifies and includes 21 studies and 26 independent samples in Eastern Europe. Poland (n=4), Serbia (n=4), Russia (n=3), and Croatia (n=3) had the greatest number of studies. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in eleven Eastern European countries including Hungary, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 18 studies with 22 samples was 30% (95% CI: 24% - 37%) and pooled prevalence of depression in 18 studies with 23 samples was 27% (95% CI: 21% - 34%).

ImplicationsThe cumulative evidence from the meta-analysis reveals high prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe. The findings suggest evidence of a potential mental health crisis in Eastern Europe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our synthesis also reveals a relative lack of studies in certain Eastern European countries as well as high heterogeneities among the existing studies, calling for more effort to achieve evidence-based mental healthcare in Eastern Europe.

Outcome was time until death or LTX. We applied Cox proportional hazard regressions using the earliest available LCI and FEV1 values and adjusted for demographic and clinical variables. For sensitivity analyses, we used the mean of the first three LCI and FEV1 measurements, stratified the cohort based on age, and investigated individuals with normal FEV1.

ResultsIn total, 237 individuals with CF aged mean (range) 13.9 (5.6-41.0) years were included. This time-to-event analysis accrued 3813 person-years, 94 (40%) individuals died or received LTX. Crude hazard ratios [95% CI] were 1.04 [1.01-1.06] per one z-score increase in LCI and 1.25 [1.11-1.41] per one z-score decrease in FEV1. After adjusting LCI and FEV1 mutually in addition to sex, age, BMI and the number of hospitalisations, hazard ratios were 1.04 [1.01-1.07] for LCI, and 1.12 [0.95-1.33] for FEV1. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results and using the mean LCI strengthened the associations.

ConclusionsIncreased ventilation inhomogeneity is associated with greater risk of death or LTX. Our data support LCI as novel surrogate of survival in individuals with CF.

TAKE HOME MESSAGELung clearance index (LCI) is a measure of global ventilation inhomogeneity which increases early during the course of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease. This study shows that LCI is predictive of death or lung transplantation in individuals with CF.

Initially, enthusiasm was high regarding their implementation as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). Yet, no country was able to prevent larger outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs, and the total effect of digital contact tracing remains elusive. Based on the results of empirical studies and modeling efforts, we show that digital contact tracing apps might have prevented cases on the order of single-digit percentages up until now, at best. We show that this poor impact can be attributed to a combination of low participation rates, a non-flexible reliance on symptom-based testing, low engagement of participants, and delays between testing and test result upload. We find that contact tracing does not change the epidemic threshold and exclusively prevents more cases during the supercritical phase of an epidemic, making it unfit as a tool to prevent outbreaks. Locally clustered contact structures may increase the interventions efficacy, but only if the number of contacts per individual is homogeneously distributed, a condition usually not found in contact networks. Our results suggest that policy makers cannot rely on digital contact tracing to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar diseases.",NA,medrxiv

With age, physical activity tends to decrease, leading down a vicious cycle that increases vulnerability to disease in the elderly. In the following, we trained neural network architectures to predict age from 115,456 one week-long 100Hz wrist accelerometer recordings from the UK Biobank (R-Squared=63.5{+/-}2.4%; root mean squared error=4.7{+/-}0.1 years). We achieved this performance by preprocessing the raw data as 2,271 scalar features, 113 time series and four images. We also considered the raw signal at different time scales (weekly activity patterns vs. gait). We then defined accelerated aging for a participant as being predicted older than ones actual age and aimed to characterize these participants. We performed a genome wide association on the accelerated aging phenotypes to estimate its heritability (h_g2=12.3{+/-}0.9%) and identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms in seven genes associated with it (e.g HIST1H4L, involved in chromatin organization). Similarly, we identified biomarkers (e.g blood pressure), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking) and socioeconomic (e.g income and education) variables associated with accelerated aging.

This relationship is further substantiated by a few small randomized-controlled trials of weight reduction and success of assisted reproduction. The aim of the current study was to expand the current evidence-base by investigating the association between BMI and subfertility in men and women using multivariable regression and Mendelian randomization.

Methods and findingsWe studied 34,157 women (average age 30, average BMI 23.1 kg/m2) and 31,496 men (average age 33, average BMI 25.4 kg/m2) who were genotyped and are participating in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. Self-reported information was available on time-to-pregnancy and BMI. A total of 10% of couples were subfertile (time-to-pregnancy [&ge;]12 months). Our findings support a J-shaped association between BMI and subfertility in both sexes using multivariable logistic regression models. Non-linear Mendelian randomization validated this relationship. A 1 kg/m2 greater genetically predicted BMI was linked to 15% greater odds of subfertility (95% confidence interval 4% to 28%) in obese women ([&ge;]30.0 kg/m2) and 14% lower odds of subfertility (-25% to -3%) in women with BMI <20.0 kg/m2. A 1 kg/m2 higher genetically predicted BMI was linked to 23% greater odds of subfertility (6% to 43%) among obese men and 36% decreased odds (-62% to 7%) among men BMI <20.0 kg/m2. A genetically predicted BMI of 23 and 25 kg/m2 was linked to the lowest subfertility risk in women and men, respectively. The main limitations of our study were that we did not know whether the subfertility was driven by the woman, man, or both; the exclusive consideration of individuals of northern European ancestry; and the limited amount of participants with obesity or BMI values <20.0 kg/m2.

ConclusionsWe observed a J-shaped relationship between BMI and subfertility in both sexes, when using both a standard multivariable regression and Mendelian randomization analysis, further supporting a potential causal role of BMI on subfertility.

Many such cases were being observed in Odisha, an eastern state of India and reported from different health care facilities. We related these unexplained serious manifestations to Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome associated with COVID 19 (MIS-C) and planned this study.

METHODSThis retrospective observational study was carried out in three tertiary care centres: Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, MKCG Medical college Berhampur and Jagannath Hospital, Bhubaneswar between July to September of year 2020. Study population include all children from 1 month to 15 years admitted to hospital with MIS-C according to WHO Diagnostic Criteria. All the data were analyzed by SPSS.

RESULTSA total of 21 children were included in our study. Maximum number of cases were male (76.2%), predominate age group was 6-10 yrs (47.6%). Predominate symptoms /signs in our observation were fever, pain abdomen, seizure and hypotension. Most of these cases were positive for SARS CoV antibody (80.95%).

A neurocircuitry model supporting fronto-limbic dysfunction as a major player in facilitating clinical symptoms of PTSD is well-characterized; however, recent literature suggests that network-based approaches may provide additional insight into neural dysfunction in PTSD. Our analysis uses resting-state neuroimaging scans of 1063 adults from the PGC-ENIGMA PTSD Consortium to investigate a network-based model of functional connectivity in PTSD. With a novel, resolution limit-free community detection approach, 16 communities corresponding to functionally meaningful networks were detected with high quality. After group-level community detection, participants were classified into three groups (PTSD, n=418, trauma-exposed controls without PTSD, n=434, and non-trauma exposed healthy controls, n=211). Individual network connectivity metrics were calculated, including whole-brain, default mode network, and central executive network participation coefficient and connectivity strength. Linear mixed effects models revealed group differences in the whole-brain, default mode, and central executive network participation coefficient and connectivity strength such that individuals with PTSD demonstrated overall greater values. We also described sex differences such that males demonstrate greater whole-brain participation coefficient vs. females and females demonstrate greater default mode network connectivity strength vs. males. Our results suggest that PTSD in adults is associated with reduced specialization and enhanced inter-module communication throughout the brain network, which may contribute to inefficient information processing and poor emotional regulation.

Studies on Plasmodium falciparum antigen diversity have focused on well-known vaccine candidates while the diversity of several others has never been studied. Here we provide an overview of the diversity and population structure of leading vaccine candidate antigens of P. falciparum using the MalariaGEN Pf3K (version 5.1) resource, comprising more than 2600 genomes from 15 malaria endemic countries. We developed a stringent variant calling pipeline to extract high quality antigen gene sequences from the global dataset and a new R-package named VaxPack to streamline population genetic analyses. In addition, a newly developed algorithm that enables spatial averaging of selection pressure on 3D protein structures was applied to the dataset. We analysed the genes encoding 23 leading and novel candidate malaria vaccine antigens including csp, trap, eba175, ama1, rh5, and CelTOS. We found that current malaria vaccine formulations are based on rare variants and thus may have limited efficacy. High levels of diversity with evidence of balancing selection was detected for most of the erythrocytic and pre-erythrocytic antigens. Measures of natural selection were then mapped to 3D protein structures to predict targets of functional antibodies. For some antigens, geographical variation in the intensity and distribution of these signals on the 3D structure suggests adaptations to different human host or mosquito vector populations. This study provides an essential framework for the diversity of P. falciparum antigens for inclusion in the design of the next generation of malaria vaccines.

Author SummaryHighly effective malaria vaccines are important for the sustainable elimination of malaria. However, the diversity of parasite antigens targeted by malaria vaccines has been largely overlooked, with most vaccine formulations based only on a single antigen variant. Failure to accommodate this diversity may result in vaccines only being effective against vaccine-like variants, resulting in limited protective efficacy. Investigation of the diversity of genes encoding parasite antigens can help prioritize and validate them as vaccine candidates as well as to identify the most common variants for inclusion in the next generation of malaria vaccines. Here we measure the diversity of 23 vaccine antigens of Plasmodium falciparum, using the publicly available MalariaGEN Pf3K (version 5.1) resource comprising more than 2600 genomes from 15 malaria endemic countries. We found that variants found in current vaccine formulations are rare and thus may target only a small proportion of circulating malaria parasite strains. Variation in intensity of immune selection in parasites from different geographic areas suggests adaptation to different human host or vector populations. This study provides an essential framework for the design of the next generation of malaria vaccines, in addition to providing novel insights into malaria biology.",NA,medrxiv

As schools reopen around the world, there is an interest in the use of saliva samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children to circumvent barriers with nasopharyngeal sampling. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of saliva sampling using RT-PCR on naso- and/or oropharyngeal swabs as the reference standard.

MethodsArticles from PubMed/MEDLINE and Living Evidence were accessed until 28th April 2021. A search method without restriction to children population was applied and during the review phase, if a study included patients <18 years old, authors were contacted to provide additional information on the subset of children. Studies were eligible if they reported on matched saliva and naso- and/or oropharyngeal samples, taken from the same patient on the same day. Studies using other respiratory samples such as sputum samples were excluded. Each paired patient sample had to be tested on the same RT-PCR platform.

ResultsTen studies were included, comprising 1486 matched saliva and on naso- and/or oropharyngeal pairs from children aged 0 to 18 years old. The pooled absolute sensitivity and specificity of saliva sampling using RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples as the reference standard was 84.5% (95% CI; 78.0%-90.3%) and 99.5% (95% CI; 98.2%-100.0%). Comparable performance of saliva to nasopharyngeal samples was shown in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children. Stratified analyses of various covariates showed no significant differences.

This study examined factors in the local area that can help a child overcome the negative impact of poverty.

MethodThis retrospective cohort study included 159,131 children who lived in Wales and completed their age 16 exams (Key Stage 4 (KS4)) between 2009 and 2016. Free School Meal (FSM) provision was used an indicator of household level deprivation. Area level deprivation was measured by the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2011. An encrypted unique Anonymous Linking Field was used to link the children with their health and educational records. The outcome variable of  Overall doing well was comprised of achieved at KS4, no mental health condition, no substance, and alcohol abuse records. Bidirectional logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between local areas deprivation and childs outcome.

Results22% of children on FSM were overall doing well compared to 54.9% of non-FSM children. FSM Children who lived in the least deprived areas are significantly more likely to do well (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) -2.20 (1.93-2.51)) than children lived in the most deprived areas. FSM children, living in areas with higher community safety, higher relative income, higher access to services, are more likely to do well than their peers.

We aimed to examine the factors influencing resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice across three Canadian provinces.

MethodsWe analyzed a subset of qualitative interview data from a study across British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. A total of 22 resident family physicians and 38 early-career family physicians in their first 10 years of practice who intend to or currently practice in a focused area were included in our analysis. We compared participant types, provinces, and the degree of focused practice while identifying themes related to factors influencing the pursuit of focused practice.

ResultsWe identified three key themes of factors contributing to choices of focused practice: self-preservation within the current health care system, support from colleagues, and experiences in medical school and/or residency. Minor themes included alignment of practice with skills, personal values, or ability to derive professional satisfaction; personal lived experiences; and having many attractive opportunities for focused practice.

InterpretationBoth groups of participants unanimously viewed focused practice as a way to circumvent the burnout or exhaustion they associated with comprehensive practice in the current structure of the health care. This finding, in addition to other influential factors, was consistent across the three provinces. More research is needed to understand the implications of resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice within the physician workforce.",NA,medrxiv

However, use of the advanced glycation end product (AGE) axis as a marker for early diastolic hemodynamic changes leading to clinical heart failure has been suggested but is less well characterized. This study explored the association between elevated Glyco% and Fibrosis 4 (FIB-4, a 4-component marker for liver fibrosis) values and worsening measures of diastolic cardiac function in order to assess their utility as early serologic markers in cardiovascular disease prevention.

Methods and ResultsA Retrospective cohort analysis was conducted in 102 patients presenting to the Parkview Medical Center health system who had received a full resting echo characterized by normal systolic ejection fraction and clinical risk factors associated with stage A heart failure in conjunction with Glyco% and FIB-4 scores all within a 3-month time window. Using regression analysis, measures of diastolic cardiac function were assessed in conjunction with rising Glyco% levels characterized as <6.5 and > 6.5 and FIB-4 scores after controlling for the presence of hypertension, coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease. Glyco% levels > 6.5 were significantly associated with a higher E/e ratio and closely associated with an elevated left atrial volume index both indicative of elevated left atrial pressure as a sensitive marker for diastolic cardiac dysfunction. FIB-4 scores did not appear to be clinically associated with progression of diastolic dysfunction.

ConclusionsGlyco%, long known to be a marker for metabolic glycemic control can also act as an early marker for identifying patients at increased risk for the progression of stage A heart failure. FIB-4 scores cannot.

To date, service users views and co-production exercises have had little impact on the development of treatment and care. This needs to change, and our paper evidences the experiences and perspectives of a diverse range of people on how community services can best address the needs of people with complex emotional needs.

MethodsA co-produced qualitative research study. Lived experience researchers led data collection and analysis. Individual interviews were conducted with 30 people across England who had a diverse range of experiences and perspectives of using community services for complex emotional needs. Participants were asked about their experiences of using community services for their mental health, and views on how community services can best address their needs. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.

ResultsParticipants reported some experiences of good practice but also of experiences of severely stigmatising treatment, a lack of effective support and service fragmentation. Relational Practice was identified as the central overarching theme and describes how community services can best support people with complex emotional needs. This approach involves care delivered in a non-stigmatising, individualised, compassionate and trauma-informed manner. It involves care that is planned collaboratively with service users to ensure their multiple needs are addressed in a flexible, holistic and consistent way which accounts for the long-term and fluctuating nature of their needs.

ConclusionsRelational practice approaches have potential to facilitate better community care for people with complex emotional needs. Research and service development are needed to examine how best to implement such approaches across the mental health service system.

DesignRegistry-based cohort study.

Setting and participants12,137 individuals with dementia registered in two national quality registries, the Swedish registry for cognitive/dementia disorders (SveDem) and the Swedish BPSD registry, during 2010 - 2016.

MethodsBPSD was assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between dementia diagnoses and different BPSDs in reference to a) the AD group and b) each of the other diagnostic groups. All models were adjusted for age, gender, the severity of cognitive impairment at the time of dementia diagnosis, and time between dementia diagnosis and BPSD assessment.

ResultsIn all individuals, the three most common symptoms were aberrant motor behaviour (35,1%), agitation (32,3%), and irritability (28,7%), while euphoria (5,9%) was the least frequent. Compared to AD, we found a lower risk of delusions (in VaD, FTD, unspecified dementia), hallucinations (in VaD and FTD), agitation (in PDD, unspecified dementia), elation/euphoria (in DLB), anxiety (in PDD, unspecified dementia), disinhibition (in PDD); irritability (in DLB, PDD, unspecified dementia), aberrant motor behavior (in Mixed, VaD, unspecified dementia) and sleep and night-time behavior changes (in unspecified dementia). Higher risks of delusions (in DLB), hallucinations (in DLB, PDD), apathy (VaD, FTD), disinhibition (in FTD) and appetite and eating abnormalities (in FTD) were found compared to AD.

Conclusions and ImplicationsIn this large contemporary cohort, BPSD was common in all types of dementia, with the most common symptoms being aberrant motor behavior, agitation, and irritability. Additionally, BPSD differed depending on the dementia type.",NA,medrxiv

Given social interventions are most likely to inform policy, we tested whether two potential intervention targets, family functioning and social capital, were associated with mental health in Colombian adolescents, and whether this was moderated by experience of violence and displacement.

MethodsWe examined the cross-sectional association between family functioning, cognitive social capital, structural social capital and 12-month prevalence of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) diagnosed psychiatric disorder, using data on 12-17-year-old adolescents (N = 1754) from the 2015 National Mental Health Survey of Colombia, a nationally representative epidemiological study. We tested whether associations survived cumulative adjustment for demographic confounders, experience of non-specific violence and harm, and displacement by armed conflict.

ResultsNeither structural nor cognitive social capital were associated with better mental health. Better family functioning was associated with reduced risk of poor mental health in an unadjusted analysis (OR 0.90 [0.85 - 0.96]), and after cumulative adjustments for demographic confounders (OR 0.91 [0.86 - 0.97]), non-specific violence and harm (OR 0.91 [0.86 - 0.97]) and social capital variables (OR 0.91 [0.85 - 0.97]). In the final model, each additional point on the family APGAR scale was associated with a 9% reduced odds of any CIDI diagnosed disorder in the last 12 months.

ConclusionsBetter family functioning was associated with better mental health outcomes for all adolescents. This effect remained present in those affected by the armed conflict even after accounting for potential confounders.",NA,medrxiv

Birth Companion is an important part of the Labour room Quality Improvement (LaQshya) programme introduced by the Government of India in 2017. Despite mandates, implementation of the concept has been unsatisfactory (9%), even though the importance of Birth Companion has increased due to enhanced risk posed by COVID-19. Little is known about awareness among health care providers on Birth Companions, perceived barriers or their suggestions.

MethodsWe canvassed a 15-question instrument using ordinal scales on 151 health care providers comprising consultants, post graduates, residents, and nurses (response rate 69%) in the department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi, India to gauge their awareness and opinions about Birth Companions.

ResultsMost health care providers across all categories were aware of the concept (93%), World Health Organizations recommendation (83%) and Governments instructions for its hospitals (68%) that every woman should be accompanied by a Birth Companion of her choice during labour. Birth Companions of choice suggested by them were the mother (70%), husband (69%). sister (46%) or nurse (43%). Most health care providers agreed that a Birth Companion should wear clean clothes (95%), be free from any communicable disease (91%), stay with the pregnant woman throughout the process of labour (74%) and should have herself gone though labour (42%). Almost all providers (95%) agreed that the presence of a Birth Companion during labour will be beneficial, as they would provide emotional support (99%), boost the womans confidence (98%), provide comfort measures like massage (95%), early initiation of breastfeeding (93%), reduce post-partum depression (91%), humanize labour (83%), reduce need for analgesia (70%) and increase spontaneous vaginal births (69%). Yet support for its introduction in their hospital was low (59%). Staff nurses had reservations (62%) with only 40% of those who believed Birth Companion to be beneficial approving of its introduction in their hospital. Over-crowding in labour room and privacy concerns for other women were identified as key barriers.

ConclusionEven though most health care providers were aware of and convinced of multiple benefits of Birth Companion during labour, lack of adequate infrastructure in the labour room prevented them from supporting its introduction. Government should provide adequate funding to upgrade labour rooms in a way that provides privacy to the delivering women and frame guidelines and train Birth Companions to perform their role appropriately.",NA,medrxiv

However, there is no consensus regarding which characteristics best predict neoantigen immunogenicity, and no model to date has both high sensitivity and specificity and a significant association with survival in response to immunotherapy. We address these challenges in the prioritization of immunogenic neoantigens by 1) identifying which neoantigen characteristics best predict immunogenicity, 2) integrating these characteristics into an immunogenicity score, NeoScore, and 3) demonstrating an improved association of the NeoScore with response to immune checkpoint inhibition compared to mutational burden. One thousand random and evenly split combinations of immunogenic and non-immunogenic neoantigens from a validated dataset were analyzed using a regularized regression model for characteristic selection. The selected characteristics, the dissociation constant and binding stability of the neoantigen:MHC class I complex and expression of the mutated gene in the tumor, were integrated into the NeoScore. A web application is provided for calculation of the NeoScore. The NeoScore results in improved, or equivalent, performance in four test datasets as measured by sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator characteristics curve compared to previous models. Among cutaneous melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibition, a high NeoScore had a greater association with improved survival compared to mutational burden.

MethodsThe Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Consent and Disclosure Recommendations Workgroup (CADRe) used a modified Expert Delphi consensus process to identify the core concepts essential to consent for clinical genetic testing. A literature review identified 77 concepts that are included in informed consent for genetic tests. Twenty five experts (9 medical geneticists, 8 genetic counselors, and 9 bioethicists) completed two rounds of Delphi surveys ranking concepts importance to informed consent.

ResultsThe most highly ranked concepts included: (1) genetic testing is voluntary; (2) why the test is recommended and what does it test for; (3) what results will be returned and to whom; (4) are there other types of potential results; what choices exist; (5) how will prognosis and management be impacted by results; (6) what is the potential family impact; (7) what are the test limitations and next steps; (8) potential risk for genetic discrimination and legal protections.

DesignFirst, a longitudinal time-series study was conducted with routinely collected smoking prevalence data for females over 16 years of age. Second, an interrupted time-series design was used as a natural experiment to assess the impact of smoke-free legislation using segmented Poisson regression.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

PopulationAll children born between 2000 and 2018 and their mothers.

Main outcome measuresOrofacial cleft incidence, reported annually for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and separately for Scotland.

ResultsOver the study period, the annual incidence of orofacial cleft per 10,000 live births ranged from 14.2-16.2 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 13.4-18.8 in Scotland. The proportion of active smokers amongst females in the United Kingdom declined by 37% during the study period. Adjusted regression analysis did not show a correlation between the proportion of active smokers and orofacial cleft incidence in either dataset, although we were unable to exclude a modest effect of the magnitude seen in individual-level observational studies. The data in England, Wales and Northern Ireland suggested an 8% reduction in orofacial cleft incidence (95%CI 1% to 14%; P=0.026) following the implementation of smoke-free legislation. In Scotland, there was weak evidence for an increase in orofacial cleft incidence following smoke-free legislation.

ConclusionThese two ecological studies offer a novel insight into the influence of smoking in orofacial cleft aetiology, adding to the evidence base from individual-level studies. Our results suggest that smoke-free legislation may have reduced orofacial cleft incidence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSSection 1: What is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAn association between maternal active and passive smoking and orofacial cleft has been previously reported in conventional individual-level observational studies
C_LIO_LIEcological and natural experiment time-series designs have been successfully used to demonstrate the association between population-level exposures and other non-cleft health outcomes
C_LI

Section 2: What this study addsO_LIEcological studies within a single country with complete cleft registration data are unlikely to be sufficiently powered to detect a relationship between time-series population level trends in active smoking and the number of children born with orofacial cleft each year.
C_LIO_LIIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland our natural experiment study showed a reduction in the proportion of children born with an orofacial cleft following the implementation of smoke-free legislation, but this was not replicated in Scotland.
C_LIO_LIThis study exploits the systematic collection of population data in the UK and adds to our understanding of the role of smoking in orofacial clefting as well as demonstrating the impact of public health interventions.

Studies have revealed significant radiological changes among RT-PCR positive asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.

ObjectiveThe aim of this cross-sectional study is to characterized chest CT findings of asymptomatic RT-PCR-positive patients in one of the COVID-designated hospitals in Nepal.

ResultsOut of 43, 26 (60.5%) participants had positive Chest CT scan findings consistent with COVID pneumonia. 65% had bilateral and 77% had multifocal lesions. The ground-glass opacities (92%), mixed (ground-glass opacities and consolidation) pattern (30.7%), and consolidation only (34.6%) were common chest CT findings. The median CT score was 3.5 (Interquartile range; 2-6).

ConclusionThe majority of the RT-PCR positive asymptomatic patient present with CT scan changes of lungs which are important to determine clinical status, prognosis, and long-term sequel in those cohorts.",NA,medrxiv

We aimed to evaluate the impact of vaccination scale-up and potential reduction in the vaccination effectiveness on the COVID-19 epidemic and social restoration in the US.

MethodsWe extended a published compartmental model and calibrated the model to the latest US COVID-19 data. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness against B.1.1.7 and evaluated the impact of a potential reduction in vaccine effectiveness on future epidemics. We projected the epidemic trends under different levels of social restoration.

ResultsWe estimated the overall existing vaccine effectiveness against B.1.1.7 to be 88.5% (95%CI: 87.4-89.5%) and vaccination coverage would reach 70% by the end of August, 2021. With this vaccine effectiveness and coverage, we anticipated 498,972 (109,998-885,947) cumulative infections and 15,443 (3,828-27,057) deaths nationwide over the next 12 months, of which 95.0% infections and 93.3% deaths were caused by B.1.1.7. Complete social restoration at 70% vaccination coverage would only slightly increase cumulative infections and deaths to 511,159 (110,578-911,740) and 15,739 (3,841-27,638), respectively. However, if the vaccine effectiveness were reduced to 75%, 50% or 25% due to new SARS-CoV-2 variants, we predicted 667,075 (130,682-1,203,468), 1.7m (0.2-3.2m), 19.0m (5.3-32.7m) new infections and 19,249 (4,281-34,217), 42,265 (5,081-79,448), 426,860 (117,229-736,490) cumulative deaths to occur over the next 12 months. Further, social restoration at a lower vaccination coverage would lead to even greater future outbreaks.

ConclusionCurrent COVID-19 vaccines remain effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, and 70% vaccination coverage would be sufficient to restore social activities to a pre-pandemic level. Further reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 variants would result in a potential surge of the epidemic in the future.",NA,medrxiv

Blood samples were collected at hospital admission (T1) (Controls and COVID-19+ patients) and 0-72 h before hospital discharge (T2, alive or dead) to analyze systemic cytokines and chemokines, LPS concentrations and soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels. THP-1 human monocytic cell line was incubated with plasma from survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients and their phenotype, activation status, TLR4, and chemokine receptors were analyzed by flow cytometry. COVID-19 patients presented higher IL-6, IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, TGF-{beta}1, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1{beta}, and CCL5/RANTES levels than controls. Moreover, LPS and sCD14 were higher at hospital admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Non-survivors COVID-19 patients had increased LPS levels concomitant with higher IL-6, TNF-, CCL2/MCP-1, and CCL5/RANTES levels at T2. Increased expression of CD16 and CCR5 were identified in THP-1 cells incubated with the plasma of survivor patients obtained at T2. The incubation of THP-1 with T2 plasma of non-survivors COVID-19 leads to higher TLR4, CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, and CD69 expression. In conclusion, increased microbial translocation during hospitalization coexist with the inflammatory condition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and could lead to higher monocyte activation in non-survivors COVID-19 patients.",NA,medrxiv

This led to the hypothesis that specific urine complement fragments may be associated with kidney disease etiologies, and disease progression may be reflected by changes in these complement fragments. We investigated the occurrence of complement fragments in urine, their association with kidney function, proteinuria and disease etiology. Mass spectrometry based peptidomics data from the Human Urinary Proteome/Peptidome Database were extracted and the distribution of complement peptides in the different kidney disease etiologies and controls was investigated. All datasets with informations on disease/health status and detectable complement peptides were included (n=16027). Twenty-three different urinary peptides derived from complement proteins could be identified, originating from the complement proteins C3, C4 and complement factor B. For most C3-derived peptides an inverse association with eGFR was observed, while the majority of peptides derived from CFB demonstrated positive association with eGFR. Highest levels of significant C3 excretion relative to controls were seen in minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), lupus nephritis (LN), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), IgAN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and C3-glomerulonephritis. In conclusion, several peptides derived from the complement proteins C3, C4 and factor B are significantly associated with specific kidney disease etiologies. These peptides may depict disease-specific complement activation, as well as damage to the glomerular basement membrane. Further targeted investigation of these peptides may provide new insight into disease pathophysiology and could possibly guide therapeutic decisions, especially when targeting complement factors.",NA,medrxiv

This study investigated the seasonal prevalence of Plasmodium sporozoite infections in the two main malaria vector species, Anopheles funestus and Anopheles arabiensis for 34 months, starting January 2018 to November 2020.

MethodsAdult mosquitoes were collected using CDC-light traps and Prokopack aspirators inside local houses in Igumbiro and Sululu villages, where earlier surveys had found very high densities of An. funestus. Collected females were sorted by taxa, and the samples examined using ELISA assays for detecting Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (Pf-CSP).

ResultsOf 7,859 An. funestus tested, 4.6% (n = 365) were positive for Pf sporozoites in the salivary glands. On the contrary, only 0.4% (n = 9) of the 2,382 An. arabiensis tested were positive. The sporozoite prevalence did not vary significantly between the villages (p = 0.36) or seasons (p = 0.59). Similarly, the proportions of parous females of either species were not significantly different between the two villages (p > 0.05) but was slightly higher in An. funestus (0.50) than in An. arabiensis (0.42). Analysis of the 2020 data determined that An. funestus contributed 98% of all malaria transmitted in households in these two villages.

ConclusionsDespite the widespread use and overall impact of ITNs, there is still excessively high Plasmodium infection prevalence in the dominant malaria vector, An. funestus, causing intense year-round malaria transmission in the study villages. Further reduction in malaria burden thus requires effective targeting of An. funestus in these and other villages with similar epidemiological conditions.",NA,medrxiv

There is a need to optimize allocation of treatment and resources in intensive care, as clinically established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II scores show only limited performance for predicting the survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Comprehensively capturing the host physiology, we speculated that proteomics in combination with new data-driven analysis strategies could produce a new generation of prognostic discriminators. We studied two independent cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 who required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation. SOFA score, Charlson comorbidity index and APACHE II score were poor predictors of survival. Plasma proteomics instead identified 14 proteins that showed concentration trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A proteomic predictor trained on single samples obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7) and weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors in an exploratory (AUROC 0.81) as well as in the independent validation cohort (AUROC of 1.0). The majority of proteins with high relevance in the prediction model belong to the coagulation system and complement cascade. Our study demonstrates that predictors derived from plasma protein levels have the potential to substantially outperform current prognostic markers in intensive care.

The on-chip AI model is designed using analog circuits for sepsis prediction with high energy efficiency for integration with resource constrained wearable device. Combination of EMR and sensor physiological data improves prediction performance compared to EMR or physiological data alone, and the late fusion model has an accuracy of 93% in predicting sepsis 4 hours before onset. The key differentiation of this work over existing sepsis prediction literature is the use of single modality patient vital (ECG) and simple demographic information, instead of comprehensive laboratory test results and multiple vital signs.

In fact, an increase of more than 20% in the years 2016 and 2017 revealed possible vulnerabilities in the national malaria-control program.

MethodsWe studied factors that are potentially associated with this reversal, including migration, economical activities, and deforestation, and weakening of investment in control programs. We analyze past incidences of malaria cases due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum with a spatio-temporal Bayesian model using more than 5 million individual records of malaria cases from January of 2003 to December of 2018 in the Brazilian Amazon to establish the municipalities with unexpected increases in cases.

ResultsWe observe an increase in imported cases from border countries in Roraima state and found small effects due to deforestation and change of occupations. Also, an overall funding reduction from 2013 to 2016 happened before an increase in malaria cases in five regions in Amazon basin, markedly for P. vivax incidence and especially, in Para and Roraima States.

ConclusionUrban developments, discontinued funding for control programs, migration from border areas, deforestation activities, and different economic activities such as mining and agriculture appear linked to the rebound on malaria incidence. These multifactorial drivers show that malaria control programs require permanent attention towards elimination.",NA,medrxiv

However, the diagnostic tests used to identify the target disease typically suffer from imperfect sensitivity and specificity, leading to biased vaccine effectiveness estimates. Here we present a solution to this problem via a Bayesian statistical model which can either incorporate point estimates of test sensitivity and specificity, or can jointly infer them directly from laboratory validation data. This approach enables uncertainties in the performance characteristics of the diagnostic test to be correctly propagated to estimates, avoiding both bias and false precision in vaccine effectiveness. By further incorporating individual covariates of study participants, and by allowing data streams from multiple diagnostic test types to be rigorously combined, our approach provides a flexible model for the analysis of TNDs with explicitly stated assumptions.",NA,medrxiv

The analysis plan was pre-registered (https://osf.io/n2k34/).

DesignMatched cohorts were assembled using a UK primary care registry (the CPRD-Aurum database). Patients were followed-up for up to 10 months, from 1st February 2020 to 9th December 2020.

SettingPrimary care database of 11,923,499 adults ([&ge;]16 years).

ParticipantsFrom 232,780 adults with a positive COVID-19 test (after excluding those with <2 years historical data or <1 week follow-up), 86,922 without prior mental illness, 19,020 with anxiety or depression, 1,036 with psychosis, 4,152 with fatigue and 4,539 with sleep problems were matched to up to four controls based on gender, general practice and year of birth. A negative control used patients who tested negative for COVID-19 and patients negative for COVID with an influenza diagnosis.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCox proportional hazard models estimated the association between a COVID-19 positive test and subsequent psychiatric morbidity (depression, anxiety, psychosis, or self-harm), sleep problems, fatigue or psychotropic prescribing. Models adjusted for comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking and BMI.

ResultsAfter adjusting for observed confounders, there was an association between testing positive for COVID-19 and almost all markers of psychiatric morbidity, fatigue and sleep problems. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for incident psychiatric morbidity was 1.75 (95% CI 1.56-1.96). However, there was a similar risk of incident psychiatric morbidity for those with a negative COVID-19 test (aHR 1.57, 95% CI 1.51-1.63) and a larger increase associated with influenza (aHR 2.97, 95% CI 1.36-6.48).

ConclusionsThere is consistent evidence that COVID-19 infection elevates risk of fatigue and sleep problems, however the results from the negative control analysis suggests that residual confounding may be responsible for at least some of the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric morbidity.",NA,medrxiv

Currently, we lack consensus about digital health research priorities in palliative care and lack theories about how these technologies might improve care outcomes. Global palliative care need is expected to increase due to the consequences of an ageing population; therefore, it is important for healthcare leaders to identify innovations to ensure that an increasingly frail population have appropriate access to palliative care services. Consequently, it is important to articulate research priorities as the first step to determine how we should allocate finite resources to a field saturated with rapidly developing innovations.

AimsTo identify research priority areas for digital health in palliative care.

MethodsWe selected the digital health trends, most relevant to palliative care, from a list of emerging trends reported by the  Future Today Institute. We conducted a modified Delphi process and consensus meeting with palliative care experts to identify research priorities. We used the views of public representatives to gain their perspectives of the agreed priorities.

ResultsOne hundred and three experts (representing 11 countries) participated in the 1st Delphi round. Fifty-five participated in the 2nd round (53% of 1st round). Eleven experts attended the final consensus meeting. We identified 16 priorities areas, which were summarised into eight themes. These themes were: big data, mobile devices, telehealth and telemedicine, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, the smart home, biotechnology and digital legacy.

ConclusionsThe identified priorities in this paper represent a wide range of important emerging areas in field of digital health, personalised medicine, and data science. Human-centred design and robust governance systems should be considered in future research. It is important that the barriers and risks of using these technologies in palliative care are properly addressed to ensure that these tools are used meaningfully, wisely and safely and that do not cause unintentional harm.",NA,medrxiv

This may have been partly caused by emergence of new variant delta. Clinical experience with the cases admitted to hospitals suggested that it is not merely a steep rise in cases but also possibly the case-profile is different. This study was taken up to investigate the differentials in the characteristics of the cases admitted in the second wave versus those admitted in the first wave.

Records of a total of 14398 cases admitted in the first wave (2020) to our network of hospitals in north India and 5454 cases admitted in the second wave (2021) were retrieved, making it the largest study of this kind in India. Their demographic profile, clinical features, management, and outcome was studied.

Age-sex distribution of the cases in the second wave was not much different from those admitted in the first wave but the patients with comorbidities and those with greater severity had larger share. Level of inflammatory markers was more adverse. More patients needed oxygen and invasive ventilation. ICU admission rate remained nearly the same. On the positive side, readmissions were lower, and the duration of hospitalization was slightly less. Usage of drugs like remdesivir and IVIG was higher while that of favipiravir and tocilizumab was lower. Steroid and anticoagulant use remained high and almost same during the two waves. More patients had secondary bacterial and fungal infections in Wave-2. Mortality increased by almost 40% in Wave-2, particularly in the younger patients of age less than 45 years. Higher mortality was observed in those admitted in wards, ICU, with or without ventilator support and those who received convalescent plasma.

No significant demographic differences in the cases in these two waves, indicates the role of other factors such as delta variant and late admissions in higher severity and more deaths.

Pulmonary function can also show long-term impairment in adults: 10% of hospitalised adults had reduced spirometry values, and 24% had decreased diffusion capacity. To date, only preliminary evidence is available on persistent respiratory sequelae in children and adolescents, therefore our objective was to examine the long-term effects of COVID-19 on pulmonary function in this age group.

MethodsMultiple-breath washout, body plethysmography, and diffusion capacity testing were performed after an average of 2.6 months (range 0.4-6.0) following COVID-19 in 73 children and adolescents (age 5-18 years) with different disease severity. Cases were compared to 45 controls with and without infection within six months prior to assessment after exclusion of severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2).

ResultsOf the 19 patients (27.1%) who complained about persistent or newly emerged symptoms since COVID-19, 8 (11.4%) reported respiratory symptoms. Comparing patients with COVID-19 to controls, no significant differences were detected in frequency of abnormal pulmonary function (COVID-19: 12, 16.4%; controls: 12, 27.7%; OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.22-1.34). Only two patients with persistent respiratory symptoms showed abnormal pulmonary function. Multivariate analysis revealed reduced forced vital capacity (p=0.045) in patients with severe infection regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DiscussionPulmonary function is rarely impaired in children and adolescents after COVID-19, except of those with severe infection. The discrepancy between persistent respiratory symptoms and normal pulmonary function suggests a different underlying pathology such as dysfunctional breathing.",NA,medrxiv

We study a setting where the decision to classify hospitals as performance outliers or non-outliers is based on the observed result of a single binary quality indicator.

MethodsWe propose to embed the classification of providers into a Bayesian decision theoretical framework which enables the derivation of optimal decision rules with respect to the expected decision consequences. We argue that these consequences depend upon for which pathway to quality improvement the profiling of hospitals takes place. We propose paradigmatic utility functions for the two pathways external reporting and change in care delivery and compare the resulting optimal decision rules with regard to their threshold values, sensitivity and specificity. We further apply them to the area of hip replacement surgeries, for which we re-evaluate hospital performances for five quality indicators in Germany during 2017.

ResultsBased on the utilities we assigned to the classification decisions, the decision rule for change in care delivery classifies more high-volume providers as outliers compared to the decision rule for external reporting, with consequences for both sensitivity and specificity. The re-evaluation of the five quality indicators illustrates that classification decisions are highly dependent upon the underlying utilities.

ConclusionAnalyzing the classification of hospitals as a decision theoretic problem and considering pathway-specific consequences of decisions can help to derive an appropriate decision rule. Contrasting decision rules with regard to their underlying assumptions about the utilities of classification consequences can be helpful to make implicit assumptions transparent and justifiable.",NA,medrxiv

The biological mechanism underlying this effect is unclear but is likely to be independent of body size in adulthood. Using a Mendelian randomization framework, we investigated 18 hypothesised mediators of the protective effect of childhood adiposity on later-life breast cancer, including hormonal, reproductive, physical, and glycaemic traits.

Our results indicate that, while most of the hypothesised mediators are affected by childhood body size, only IGF-1, testosterone, age at menarche and age at menopause influenced breast cancer risk. However, accounting for those traits in multivariable Mendelian randomization showed that the protective effect of childhood body size still remained. This suggests either a direct effect of childhood body size on breast cancer risk or mediation via other pathways not considered.

Our work presents a framework for the systematic exploration of potential biological mediators of disease in Mendelian randomization analysis.",NA,medrxiv

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with increasing sample sizes have reported preliminary genetic associations for cervical cancer. However, GWAS is only the first step in mapping the genetic susceptibility and thus, the underlying biology in cervical cancer and other cervical phenotypes is still not entirely understood. Here, we use data from large biobanks to characterise the genetics of cervical phenotypes (including cervical cancer) and leverage latest computational methods and gene expression data to refine the association signals for cervical cancer.

MethodsUsing Estonian Biobank and FinnGen data, we characterise the genetic signals associated with cervical ectropion (10,162 cases/151,347 controls), cervicitis (19,285/185,708) and cervical dysplasia (14,694/150,563). We present the results from the largest trans-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis of cervical cancer, including up to 9,229 cases and 490,304 controls from Estonian Biobank, the FinnGen study, the UK Biobank and Biobank Japan. We combine GWAS results with gene expression data and chromatin regulatory annotations in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells to propose the most likely candidate genes and causal variants for every locus associated with cervical cancer. We further dissect the HLA association with cervical pathology using imputed data on alleles and amino acid polymorphisms.

ResultsWe report a single associated locus on 2q13 for both cervical ectropion (rs3748916, p=5.1 x 10-16) and cervicitis (rs1049137, p=3.9 x 10-10), and five signals for cervical dysplasia - HLA-B and HLA-DQA1 (rs1053726, p=9.1 x 10-9; rs36214159, 1.6 x 10-22), DAPL1 (rs12611652, p=3.2 x 10-9), PAX8 (rs1049137, p=6.4 x 10-9), and CLPTM1L (rs6866294, p=2.1 x 10-9). We identify five loci associated with cervical cancer in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis: LINC00339/CDC42 (rs2268177, p= 3.1 x 10-8), PAX8/PAX8-AS1 (rs4849177, p=9.4 x 10-15), CLPTM1L (rs27069, p=1.3 x 10-14), GSDMB (rs12603332, p=1.2 x 10-9), and HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1 (rs35508382, p=1.0 x 10-39). Joint analysis of dysplasia and cancer datasets revealed an association on chromosome 19 (rs425787, p=3.5 x 10-8), near CD70.

DiscussionOur results map PAX8/PAX8-AS1, LINC00339, CDC42, CLPTM1L, HLA-DRB1, HLA-B, and GSDMB as the most likely candidate genes for cervical cancer, which provides novel insight into cervical cancer pathogenesis and supports the role of genes involved in reproductive tract development, immune response, and cellular proliferation/apoptosis. We further show that PAX8/PAX8-AS1 has a central role in cervical biology and pathology, as it was associated with all analysed phenotypes.

This prospective study was carried out in the Association of EISEIKAI Medical and Healthcare Corporation Minamitama Hospital, in Tokyo, Japan, from April 15, 2021 to June 09, 2021. All our hospitals workers who were administered the BNT162b2 vaccine as part of a routine program were included in this study.

We calculated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibody titter 1) before vaccination, 2) seven to twenty days after the first vaccination, and 3) seven to twenty days after the second vaccination.

The low-antibody titer group (LABG) was defined as the group having less than 25 percentiles of antibody titer. Univariate and Multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to ascertain the effects of factors on the likelihood of LABG. 374 participants were eventually included in our study, and they were divided into 94 LABG and 280 non-LABG. All samples showed significant antibody elevation in the second antibody test, with a mean value of 3476 U/mL. When comparing the LABG and non-LABG groups, the median age, blood sugar, and HbA1c were significantly higher in the LABG group. The rates of participants with low BMI (<18.5) and high BMI (>30) were significantly higher in the LABG group. The proportion of chronic lung disease, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, autoimmune disease, and cancer were significantly higher in the LABG group. Although there was no significant difference confirmed with respect to the exercise hours per day, the proportion of participants that did not perform outdoor activities was significantly higher in the LABG group. The time interval between the second vaccination and the second antibody test, and between the first and the second vaccination was significantly longer in the non-LABG group.

Our logistic regression analysis revealed that the age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, antihypertensive drug, antilipid drug, {gamma}-GT, BS, HbA1c, and lack of outdoor activity were significant suppressors of antibody reaction, whereas maintaining the appropriate time interval between the first and the second vaccination could promote a significant antibody response. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, obesity, and lack of outdoor activities were significant suppressors of antibody reaction, whereas the length of days from the first to the second vaccination promoted a significant antibody response.

Our single-center study demonstrates that age, obesity, and lack of outdoor activities were significant suppressors of antibody response, whereas maintaining the appropriate time interval between the first and the second vaccination could promote a significant antibody response. Evidence from multi-center studies is needed to develop further vaccination strategies.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsNational prospective longitudinal cohort study that included 32,385 participants aged 25-64 during 1992-2012. Of these, 288 suffered from a major TBI (diagnosis of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and hospital length of stay (LOS) [&ge;]3 days) and 406 from a minor TBI (concussion diagnosis and hospital LOS [&le;]1 day). Dementia was defined as any first hospital contact with a diagnosis of dementia; first use of an anti-dementia drug; and dementia as an underlying or contributing cause of death.

Sample processing was streamlined significantly through automation, reducing the turnaround time by 20-fold and exceeding the scale of similar surveillance programs by 10 to 100-fold, thereby overcoming one of the biggest bottlenecks in wastewater surveillance. An automated wastewater notification system was developed to alert residents to a positive wastewater sample associated with their residence and to encourage uptake of campus-provided asymptomatic testing at no charge. This system, integrated with the rest of the ""Return to Learn"" program at UC San Diego-led to the early diagnosis of nearly 85% of all COVID-19 cases on campus. Covid-19 testing rates increased by 1.9-13X following wastewater notifications. Our study shows the potential for a robust, efficient wastewater surveillance system to greatly reduce infection risk as college campuses and other high-risk environments reopen.

IMPORTANCEWastewater based epidemiology can be particularly valuable at University campuses where high-resolution spatial sampling in a well-controlled context could not only provide insight into what affects campus community as well as how those inferences can be extended to a broader city/county context. In the present study, a large-scale wastewater surveillance was successfully implemented on a large university campus enabling early detection of 85% of COVID-19 cases thereby averting potential outbreaks. The highly automated sample processing to reporting system enabled dramatically reduced the turnaround time to 5h (sample to result time) for 96 samples. Furthermore, miniaturization of the sample processing pipeline brought down the processing cost significantly ($13/sample). Taken together, these results show that such a system could greatly ameliorate long-term surveillance on such communities as they look to reopen.",NA,medrxiv

Due to the poor accessibility to the target organ, CNS-confined processes underpinning the later progressive form of MS remain elusive thereby limiting treatment options. We aim to examine DNA methylation, a stable epigenetic mark of genome activity, in glial cells to capture relevant molecular changes underlying MS neuropathology.

MethodsWe profiled DNA methylation in nuclei of glial cells, isolated from 38 post-mortem normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) specimens of MS patients (n=8) in comparison to white matter of control individuals (n=14), using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip.

FindingsWe identified 1,226 significant (genome-wide adjusted P-value < 0.05) differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between MS patients and controls. Functional annotation of the altered DMP-genes uncovered alterations of processes related to cellular motility, cytoskeleton dynamics, metabolic processes, synaptic support, neuroinflammation and signaling, such as Wnt and TGF-{beta} pathways. A fraction of the affected genes displayed transcriptional differences in the brain of MS patients, as reported by publically available transcriptomic data. Cell type-restricted annotation of DMP-genes attributed alteration of cytoskeleton rearrangement and extracellular matrix remodelling to all glial cell types, while some processes, including ion transport, Wnt/TGF-{beta} signaling and immune processes were more specifically linked to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglial cells, respectively.

ConclusionOur findings strongly suggest that NAWM glial cells are highly altered, even in the absence of lesional insult, collectively exhibiting a multicellular reaction in response to diffuse inflammation.",NA,medrxiv

To reduce mortality, in addiction to mass vaccination, it is necessary to massify and accelerate clinical diagnosis, as well as creating new ways of monitoring patients that can help in the construction of specific treatments for the disease.

ObjectiveIn this work, we propose rapid protocols for clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 through the automatic analysis of hematological parameters using Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning. These hematological parameters are obtained from blood tests common in clinical practice.

MethodWe investigated the best classifier architectures. Then, we applied the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to select the most relevant attributes: serum glucose, troponin, partial thromboplastin time, ferritin, D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, and indirect bilirubin. Finally, we used decision trees to build four rapid protocols for Covid-19 clinical diagnosis.

ResultsWe developed a web system for Covid-19 diagnosis support. Using a 100-tree Random Forest, we obtained results for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity superior to 99

ConclusionBy using a reduced set of hematological parameters common in clinical practice, it was possible to achieve results of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity comparable to those obtained with RT-PCR. It was also possible to automatically generate clinical decision protocols, allowing relatively accurate clinical diagnosis even without the aid of the web decision support system.",NA,medrxiv

MethodsDrug purchase data from the China Drug Supply Information Platform (CDSIP) database were used, involving nine ""4+7"" pilot cities and 12 non-pilot provinces in China. ""4+7"" policy-related drugs were included, which consisted of 25 ""4+7"" List drugs and 97 alternative drugs that have an alternative relationship with ""4+7"" List drugs in clinical use. ""4+7"" List drugs were divided into bid-winning and non-winning products according to the bidding results. Purchase volume, purchase expenditures, daily costs were selected as outcome variables, and were measured using Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), Chinese Yuan (CNY), and Defined Daily Drug cost (DDDc), respectively. Difference-in-Difference (DID) method was employed to estimate the net effect of policy impact.

ResultsAfter policy intervention, the DDDs of original drugs among ""4+7"" List drugs significantly reduced by 124.59%, while generic drugs increased by 52.12% (all p-values <0.01). 17.08% of the original drugs in DDDs were substituted by generic drugs. Prominent reductions of 121.69% and 80.54% were observed in the expenditure of original and generic drugs, with a total cost-saving of 5036.78 million CNY for ""4+7"" List drugs. The DDDc of bid-winning original and generic drugs, as well as non-winning original drugs, significantly decreased by 33.20%, 75.74%, and 5.35% (all p-values <0.01), while the DDDc of non-winning generic drugs significantly increased by 73.66% (p<0.001). The use proportion of bid-winning products and non-winning original drugs raised prominently from 39.66% to 91.93%

Conclusions""4+7"" policy promoted the substitution use of generic drugs against original drugs, which conducive to drug costs saving. The overall quality level of drug use of public medical institutions significantly increased after ""4+7"" policy, especially in primary medical institutions.

Strengths and limitations of this study[tpltrtarr] The ""4+7"" policy is the first policy attempt of volume-based drug procurement work at the national level in China, and is a pioneering work in the reform of Drug Supply and Guarantee System in China. This study aimed to explored the effect of this policy on original and generic drug use in China.

In this study, we aim to estimate the rate of change in average daily travel distance from a participants registered address before and after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

MethodParticipants were recruited into Virus Watch starting in June 2020. Weekly surveys were sent out to participants and vaccination status was collected from January 2021 onwards. Between September 2020 and February 2021, we invited 13,120 adult Virus Watch participants to contribute towards our tracker sub-cohort which uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect data on movement. We used segmented linear regression to estimate the median daily travel distance before and after the first self-reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose.

ResultsWe analysed the daily travel distance of 228 vaccinated adults. Between 157 days prior to vaccination until the day before vaccination, the median daily travel distance travelled was 8.9km (IQR: 3.50km, 24.17km). Between the day of vaccination and 100 days after vaccination, the median daily travel distance travelled was 10.30km (IQR: 4.11, 27.53km). Between 157 days prior to vaccination and the vaccination date, there was a daily median decrease in mobility of 40m (95%CI: -51m, -31m, p-value <0.001) per day. After the removal of outlier data, and between the vaccination date and 99 days after vaccination, there was a median daily increase in movement of 45.0m (95%CI: 25m, 65m, p-value = <0.001). Restricting the analysis to the 3rd national lockdown (4th of January 2021 to the 5th of April 2021), we found a median daily movement increase of 9m (95%CI: -25m, 45m, p = 0.57) in the 30 days prior to vaccination and the vaccination date, and a median daily movement increase of 10m (95%CI: -60m, 94m, p-value = 0.69) in the 30 days after vaccination.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting high volume geolocation data as part of research projects, and the utility of these for understanding public health issues.

We cannot reliably predict who will recover quickly or suffer with mild debilitating long COVID-19 symptoms or battle life-threatening complications. In order to address some of these questions, we studied the presence of symptoms and various correlates in COVID-19 patients who were discharged from hospital, 3 months and up to 12 months after acute COVID-19 illness.

MethodsThis is an observational follow-up study of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at 3 hospitals in north India between April - August 2020. Patients were interviewed telephonically using a questionnaire regarding the post-COVID symptoms. The first tele-calling was done in the month of September 2020, which corresponded to 4-16 weeks after disease onset. All those who reported presence of long COVID symptoms, were followed-up with a second call, in the month of March 2021, corresponding to around 9-12 months after the onset of disease.

ResultsOf 990 patients who responded to the first call, 615 (62.2%) had mild illness, 227 (22.9%) had moderate and 148 (15.0%) had severe COVID-19 illness at the time of admission. Nearly 40% (399) of these 990 patients reported at least one symptom at that time. Of these 399 long-COVID patients, 311 (almost 78%) responded to the second follow-up. Nearly 8% reported ongoing symptomatic COVID, lasting 1-3 months and 32% patients having post-COVID phase with symptoms lasting 3-12 months. Nearly 11% patients continued to have at least one symptom even at the time of the second interview (9-12 months after the disease onset). Overall, we observed Long-COVID in almost 40% of our study group. Incidence of the symptoms in both the follow-ups remained almost same across age-groups, gender, severity of illness at admission and presence of comorbidity, with no significant association with any of them. Most common symptoms experienced in long COVID phase in our cohort were fatigue, myalgia, neuro-psychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, ""brain fog"" and sleep disorder, and breathlessness. Fatigue was found to be significantly more often reported in the elderly population and in those patients who had a severe COVID-19 illness at the time of admission. Persistence of breathlessness was also reported significantly more often in those who had severe disease at the onset. The overall median duration of long COVID symptoms was 16.9 weeks with inter-quartile range of 12.4 to 35.6 weeks. The duration of symptom resolution was not associated with age, gender or comorbidity but was significantly associated with severity of illness at the time of admission (P=0.006).

ConclusionsLong-COVID is now being recognized as a new disease entity, which includes a constellation of symptoms. Long-COVID was in almost 40% of our study group with no correlation to age, gender, comorbidities or to the disease severity. The duration of symptom resolution was significantly associated with severity of illness at the time of admission (P = 0.006). In our study, all patients reported minor symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, neuro-psychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, ""brain fog"" and sleep disorder and persistence of breathlessness. Severe organ damage was not reported by our subjects. This might be the longest post-COVID follow-up study on a sample of nearly 1000 cases from India.",NA,medrxiv

Vaccination of the elderly and chronically ill was prioritized and the interval between doses set to 12 weeks. The objective of this interim analysis was to evaluate first and second dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a real-world setting.

MethodsDuring the first 5 months of the campaign, a register-based cohort study was conducted in the Finnish elderly aged 70+ years and those aged 16-69 years with medical conditions predisposing to severe Covid-19 (chronically ill). Using Cox regression, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalization was estimated comparing the hazard in the vaccinated with that in the unvaccinated.

ResultsThe cohorts included 901092 elderly (89% vaccinated) and 774526 chronically ill (69% vaccinated) individuals. Three weeks after the first dose, mRNA VE against infection was 45% (95% confidence interval, 36-53%) and 40% (26-51%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalization was 63% (49-74%) and 82% (56-93%). In chronically ill, AdV VE was 42% (32-50) and 62% (42- 75%) against infection and hospitalization, respectively. One week after the second dose, mRNA VE against infection was 75% (65-82%) and 77% (65-85%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalization was 93% (70-98%) and 90% (29-99%).

ConclusionsCovid-19 vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalization. A single dose provides moderate protection in elderly and chronically ill, although 2 doses are clearly superior.

summaryThis register-based cohort study demonstrates that Covid-19 vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalization among Finnish elderly and chronically ill. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was moderate after 1 dose and increased to [&ge;]90% after 2 doses.",NA,medrxiv

We systematically reviewed epidemiological and economic modelling evidence on population priority groups to minimise COVID-19 mortality, transmission and morbidity outcomes.

MethodsWe searched the National Institute of Health iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio (a database of peer-reviewed and pre-print articles), Econlit, the Centre for Economic Policy Research and the National Bureau of Economic Research for mathematical modelling studies evaluating the impact of prioritising COVID-19 vaccination to population target groups. We narratively synthesised the main study conclusions on prioritisation and the conditions under which the conclusions changed.

FindingsThe search identified 1820 studies. 36 studies met the inclusion criteria and were narratively synthesised. 83% of studies described outcomes in high-income countries. We found that for countries seeking to minimise deaths, prioritising vaccination of senior adults was the optimal strategy and for countries seeking to minimise cases the young were prioritised. There were several exceptions to the main conclusion, notably reductions in deaths could be increased, if groups at high risk of both transmission and death could be further identified. Findings were also sensitive to the level of vaccine coverage.

InterpretationThe evidence supports WHO SAGE recommendations on COVID-19 vaccine prioritisation. There is however an evidence gap on optimal prioritisation for low- and middle-income countries, studies that included an economic evaluation, and studies that explore prioritisation strategies if the aim is to reduce overall health burden including morbidity.",NA,medrxiv

These receptors, including bitter taste receptors (T2Rs), may play an important role in regulating gut function and appetite.

ObjectiveTo establish the ability of Amarasate(R), a bitter supercritical CO2 extract of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) to modify acute energy intake, appetite and hormonal responses and establish a site of action.

DesignNineteen healthy-weight (BMI = 23.5 {+/-} 0.3 kg/m2) male volunteers completed a randomised three-treatment, double blind, cross-over study with a 1 week washout between treatments. Overnight-fasted participants were cannulated and provided with a standardised 2 MJ breakfast meal. Treatments comprised a vehicle control (Placebo) or hops extract administered in either quick release (Gastric) or delayed release (Duodenal) capsules. Ad libitum energy intake was recorded at an outcome lunch (1200 h) and afternoon snack (1400 h), with blood samples taken and subjective ratings of appetite, gastrointestinal discomfort, vitality, meal palatability and mood assessed throughout the day.

ResultsCompared with placebo, both gastric and duodenal treatments significantly reduced total ad libitum energy intake by 911 {+/-} 308 kJ and 944 {+/-} 309 kJ, respectively. Both gastric and duodenal treatments significantly increased pre-meal ghrelin and post-prandial CCK, GLP-1 and PYY responses while reducing postprandial insulin, GIP and PP secretion with no significant impact on glycemia. In addition, gastric and duodenal treatments produced small but significant changes in measures of gastrointestinal discomfort, vitality and mood, with mild-moderate adverse GI symptoms reported in the gastric treatment only. However, no significant treatment effects were observed for any subjective measures of appetite or meal palatability.

ConclusionBoth gastric and duodenal delivery of Amarasate modulate the release of hormones involved in appetite and glycaemic regulation, providing a potential ""bitter brake"" on energy intake in healthy-weight men.",NA,medrxiv

Several studies have indicated that TM expands the scope, extent, and application of breast conservation surgery. This report describes in detail TM outcomes in Indian breast cancer (BC) patients.

MethodsFrom our single institutional cohort (n = 211), we present data related to surgical techniques, clinical management, oncological safety, cosmetic and patient reported outcomes (PROMs, based on Breast-Q questionnaire) from BC patients who underwent TM (categorized as simple, complex, extreme and split-reduction type)

ResultsMean age at diagnosis was 48.7 years. Majority of these patients had advanced stage (II/III) disease. 178 patients consented and 171 completed 1 year follow-up from 3 main groups (a) simple (n=87) (b) complex (n =39) and (c) extreme TM (n = 49). The post-operative complication rates were low (<10%) without any delay in adjuvant treatment. Cosmetic scores were good-to-excellent (n = 154). Post-1-year PROMs (n=149) revealed good-to-excellent score for satisfaction with breast, cosmetic outcome and psychosocial well-being for all TM types.

ConclusionOur study is a first detailed report describing a multi-factorial audit in TM single institutional cohort in Indian BC patients.

Currently, few treatment options exist for post stroke fatigue, a condition frequently associated with depression. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in alleviating fatigue and depression in other patient groups, but the acceptability and effects for chronic phase stroke survivors are not established. Here, we used a randomized sham-controlled design to evaluate the added effect of tDCS combined with computerized cognitive training to alleviate symptoms of fatigue and depression. 74 patients were enrolled at baseline (mean time since stroke = 26 months) and 54 patients completed the intervention. Self-report measures of fatigue and depression were collected at five consecutive timepoints, spanning a period of two months. While fatigue and depression severity were reduced during the course of the intervention, Bayesian analyses provided evidence for no added effect of tDCS. Less severe symptoms of fatigue and depression were associated with higher improvement rate in select tasks, and study withdrawal was higher in patients with more severe fatigue and younger age. Time-resolved analyses of individual symptoms by a network-approach suggested overall higher centrality of fatigue symptoms (except item 1 and 2) than depression symptoms. In conclusion, the results support the notion of fatigue as a significant stroke sequela with possible implications for treatment adherence and response, but reveal no effect of tDCS on fatigue or depression.",NA,medrxiv

The manic state is characterized by increased variance, augmented complexity and irregular circadian rhythmicity when compared to healthy controls. The aim was to characterize differences in motor activity when comparing manic patients to their euthymic selves.

MethodsMotor activity was collected from 14 bipolar inpatients in mania and remission. 24-h recordings and 2-h time series in the morning and evening were analyzed for mean activity, variability and complexity. Lastly, the recordings were analyzed with the similarity graph algorithm and graph theory concepts such as edges, bridges, connected components and cliques.

ResultsWhen compared to euthymia, over the duration of approximately one circadian cycle, the manic state presented reduced variability, displayed by decreased standard deviation (p = 0.013) and augmented complexity shown by increased sample entropy (p = 0.025). During mania there were also fewer edges (p = 0.039) and more bridges (p = 0.026). Similar changes in variability and complexity were observed in the 2-h morning and evening sequences, mainly in the estimates of the similarity graph algorithm. A comparison of morning and evening sequences within states revealed no significant change in estimates for mania. Contrarily, the euthymic state showed significant evening differences in variance and complexity, displayed by fewer edges (p = 0.010) and an increased number of connected components (p = 0.009).

Many COVID -19 positive patients had to stay at home and reach out to their family physicians for guidance. This gave us an opportunity to observe a group of patients in home quarantine. The challenge was daunting. We could not afford to allow these patients to deteriorate as hospital beds and oxygen support were not readily available. Therefore, we developed an innovative approach to monitor these patients and to intervene at the optimal time to avoid hospitalization.

Based on objective biochemical tests like elevated CRP and clinical signs like persistent high-grade fever, we initiated early low dose steroids and antibiotics prior to the onset of hypoxia. None of the home quarantined patients deteriorated because of the timely medical intervention. These patients neither required oxygen support nor hospitalization. We therefore present our new treatment model for home quarantined COVID-19 patients along with our suggestions for implementing the model at the community level.

Methods25 patients under home quarantine who contacted online for medical guidance underwent clinical and biochemical evaluation. CT radiological examination was done whenever indicated. Treatments were initiated under medical guidance based on the CRP values and clinical presentation.

ResultsAmong the 25 patients, 40% of the patients (10/25) had mild symptoms with normal CRP. 24% of the patients (6/25) had mild symptoms with elevated CRP. 36% of patients (9/25) had elevated CRP with persistent high fever. All the 25 patients recovered over the next four weeks.

ConclusionWe propose an early objective assessment of inflammatory markers like CRP prior to the onset of hypoxia during home quarantine and early, need-based intervention under medical guidance to avoid complications and hospitalization.",NA,medrxiv

With the proliferation of large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in recent years, investigators have turned to polygenic scores to leverage GWAS results into a measure of genetic risk that can better predict risk of disease than individual significant variants alone.

We selected 54 polygenic risk scores (PRSs) developed for a variety of outcomes and we calculated their values in individuals from the New England Centenarian Study (NECS, N = 4886) and the Long Life Family Study (LLFS, N = 4577). We compared the distribution of these PRSs among exceptionally long-lived individuals (ELLI), their offspring and controls and we also examined their predictive values, using t-tests and regression models adjusting for sex and principal components reflecting ancestral background of the individuals (PCs). In our analyses we controlled for multiple testing using a Bonferroni-adjusted threshold for 54 traits.

We found that only 4 of the 54 PRSs differed between ELLIs and controls in both cohorts. ELLIs had significantly lower mean PRSs for Alzheimers disease (AD), coronary artery disease (CAD) and systemic lupus than controls, suggesting genetic predisposition to extreme longevity may be mediated by reduced susceptibility to these traits. ELLIs also had significantly higher mean PRSs for improved cognitive function. In addition, the PRS for AD was associated with higher risk of dementia among controls but not ELLIs (p = 0.0004, 0.3 in NECS, p = 0.03, 0.93 in LLFS respectively). Interestingly, ELLIs did not have a larger number of homozygous risk genotypes for AD (TNECS = -1.72, TLLFs = 0.83) and CAD (TNECS = -5.08, TLLFs = -0.31) in both cohorts, but did have significantly larger number of homozygous protective genotypes than controls for the two traits (AD: TNECS =3.10, TLLFs = 2.2, CAD: TNECS = 6.57, TLLFs =2.36, respectively).

ELLIs have a similar burden of genetic disease risk as the general population for most traits, but have significantly lower genetic risk of AD, CAD, and lupus. The lack of association between AD PRS and dementia among ELLIs suggests that their genetic risk for AD is somehow buffered by protective genetic or environmental factors.",NA,medrxiv

We estimated the total annual cost per patient and total cost per patient virally suppressed in five DSDMs, including facility- and community-based models and the standard of care.

MethodsWe conducted a cost/outcome study from the perspective of the service provider, using retrospective patient record review of a cohort of patients over a two-year period, with bottom-up collection of patients resource utilization data, top-down collection of above-delivery level and delivery-level providers fixed operational costs, and local unit costs. We enrolled adults on ART (>18 years old) enrolled in 47 DSDMs located at facilities or community-based service points in four regions of Uganda with at least 24 months of follow-up data. DSDMs assessed included facility-based groups (FBG); fast-track drug refills (FDR); community client-led ART delivery (CCLAD); community drug distribution points (CDDP); and facility-based individual management (FBIM), which is the standard of care model for new, complex, and virally unsuppressed patients. Viral suppression was defined as <1000 copies/ml.

ResultsRetention in care was 98% for the sample as a whole [96-100%]. Over viral suppression was 91%, which varied from 86% among patients in FBIM (with the largest share of complex / virally unsuppressed patients) to 93% among CDDP patients. The mean cost to the provider (Ministry of Health or NGO implementers) was $152 per annum per patient treated, ranging from $141 for FBG to $166 for FDR. Differences among the models costs were largely due to patients ARV regimens and proportions of patients on second line regimens. Service delivery costs, excluding ARVs, other medicines and laboratory tests, were modest, ranging from $9.66-16.43 per patient.

ConclusionsDifferentiated ART service delivery in Uganda achieved excellent treatment outcomes at a cost similar to the standard of care (FBIM). While large budgetary savings might not be immediately realized, the reallocation of ""saved"" staff time could improve health system efficiency as facilities and patients gain more experience with DSD models.",NA,medrxiv

Assessment of the ability of sera from vaccine recipients to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants will inform the success of strategies for minimising COVID19 cases and the design of effective antigenic formulations. Here, we examine the sensitivity of variants of concern (VOCs) representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (first associated with infections in India) and B.1.351 (first associated with infection in South Africa) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccines. Across all vaccinated individuals, the spike glycoproteins from B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 conferred reductions in neutralisation of 4.31 and 5.11-fold respectively. The reduction seen with the B.1.617.2 lineage approached that conferred by the glycoprotein from B.1.351 (South African) variant (6.29-fold reduction) that is known to be associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Neutralising antibody titres elicited by vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were significantly higher than those elicited by vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Fold decreases in the magnitude of neutralisation titre following two doses of BNT162b2, conferred reductions in titre of 7.77, 11.30 and 9.56-fold respectively to B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses, the reduction in neutralisation of the delta variant B.1.617.2 surpassing that of B.1.351. Fold changes in those vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 were 0.69, 4.01 and 1.48 respectively. The accumulation of mutations in these VOCs, and others, demonstrate the quantifiable risk of antigenic drift and subsequent reduction in vaccine efficacy. Accordingly, booster vaccines based on updated variants are likely to be required over time to prevent productive infection. This study also suggests that two dose regimes of vaccine are required for maximal BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-induced immunity.",NA,medrxiv

However, research in this area often relies upon recollection dependant questionnaires or diaries. Accelerometers provide an alternative tool for deriving sleep parameters measuring sleep patterns objectively. This study examines the associations between accelerometer derived sleep onset timing and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods and ResultsWe derived sleep onset and waking up time from accelerometer data collected from 103,712 UK Biobank participants over a period of seven days. From this, we examined the association between sleep onset timing and CVD incidence using a series of Cox proportional hazards models. 3172 cases of CVD were reported during a mean follow-up period of 5{middle dot}7 ({+/-}0{middle dot}49) years. An age- and sex-controlled base analysis found that sleep onset time of 10:00pm-10:59pm was associated with the lowest CVD incidence. A fully adjusted model, additionally controlling for sleep duration, sleep irregularity, and established CVD risk factors, was unable to eliminate this association, producing hazard ratios of 1{middle dot}24 (95% CI, 1{middle dot}10-1{middle dot}39; p<0{middle dot}005), 1{middle dot}12 (1{middle dot}01-1{middle dot}25; p=0{middle dot}04), and 1{middle dot}25 (1{middle dot}02-1{middle dot}52; p=0{middle dot}03) for sleep onset <10:00pm, 11:00pm-11:59pm, and [&ge;]12:00am, respectively, compared to 10:00pm-10:59pm. Importantly, sensitivity analyses revealed this association was stronger in females, with only sleep onset <10:00pm significant for males.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest an independent relationship between sleep onset timing and risk of developing CVD, particularly for women. We also demonstrate the potential utility of collecting information about sleep parameters via accelerometry-capable wearable devices, which may serve as novel cardiovascular risk indicators.

Translational PerspectiveAbnormal sleep timing is a feature of poor-quality sleep and is likely to be associated with cardiovascular diseases. Accelerometer-derived measures of sleep quality, particularly sleep timing, may be associated with greater vulnerability to cardiovascular disease, particularly in women. Onset of sleep timing may constitute a novel cardiovascular risk factor and target for preventative intervention. Wearable devices equipped with accelerometers may be useful in assessing sleep related cardiovascular disease risk factors as they would allow passive measurement of sleep parameters, such as sleep timing.",NA,medrxiv

Although age and sex strongly predict the risk of CAD, their interaction with genetic risk prediction has not been systematically examined.

ObjectivesThis study performed an in-depth evaluation of age and sex effects in genetic CAD risk prediction.

MethodsThe population-based Norwegian HUNT2 cohort of 51,036 individuals was used as the primary dataset. Findings were replicated in the UK Biobank (372,410 individuals). Models for 10-year CAD risk were fitted using Cox proportional hazards and Harrells concordance index, sensitivity, and specificity were compared.

ResultsInclusion of age and sex interactions of PGSCAD to the prediction models increased C-index and sensitivity likely countering the observed survival bias in the baseline. The sensitivity for females was lower than males in all models including genetic information. The two-step approach identified a total of 82.6% of incident CAD cases (74.1% by ASCVD risk score and an additional 8.5% by the PGSCAD interaction model).

ConclusionThese findings highlight the importance and complexity of genetic risk in predicting CAD. There is a need for modeling age and sex-interactions terms with polygenic scores to optimize detection of individuals at high-risk, those who warrant preventive interventions. Sex-specific studies are needed to understand and estimate CAD risk with genetic information.

CONDENSED ABSTRACTThis study used two large population-based longitudinal datasets to evaluate genetic prediction of CAD including age and sex interactions. The model fit and sensitivity of the prediction models increased when including age and sex interaction of PGSCAD to the prediction models likely countering the observed survival bias in the baseline. The sensitivity for females was lower than for males in all models including genetic information. Our results highlight the importance and complexity of genetic risk and suggest including age and sex interactions with polygenic scores to identify more high-risk individuals for preventive interventions.",NA,medrxiv

In East Africa, there is a paucity of data regarding the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to antimicrobial use (AMU). Here we investigate the ways in which antimicrobial users in the veterinary sector accessed veterinary antimicrobials, and common behaviours of veterinary antimicrobial users and prescribers associated with AMU and AMR.

MethodsIn total, 70 farmers, staff at 49 agricultural-veterinary antimicrobial shops (agrovet staff) and 28 veterinary animal healthcare workers or veterinary surgeons (veterinary professionals) were interviewed in Busia county, western Kenya in 2016 using a standard questionnaire as a framework for structured interviews. Data recorded included participant demographics, level of education, access to and sources of veterinary antimicrobials, prescribing patterns and knowledge of AMR and antimicrobial withdrawal periods.

ResultsThe majority of antimicrobials were accessed through informal means, purchased from agroveterinary shops; more than half of staff did not hold nationally mandated qualifications to advise on or sell veterinary antimicrobials. Approximately 40% of veterinary antimicrobials were sold without a prescription and it was noted that both price and customer preference were important factors when selling antimicrobials in almost all agrovet shops. Knowledge of the dangers associated with AMR and AMU were mostly superficial. Treatment failure occurred often, and there was a lack of differentiation between AMR and simply treatment failure.

ConclusionIn this study area in East Africa with high-density human and livestock populations, AMU was primarily for maintenance of livestock health. These findings have highlighted several aspects surrounding inappropriate access to antimicrobials, and as such require attention from policy makers concerned with AMR in both livestock and human medicine sectors. Improving prescribing practices and ensuring a minimum level of general education and awareness of prescribers, as well as expanding the role of agrovet staff in antimicrobial stewardship programmes, may help begin to mitigate the maintenance and transmission of AMR, particularly amongst livestock.",NA,medrxiv

Materials and MethodsWe represent RCT cohort enrollment as random binary classification fairness problems, and then show how ML fairness metrics based on enrollment fraction can be efficiently calculated using easily computed rates of subpopulations in RCT cohorts and target populations. We propose standardized versions of these metrics and deploy them in an interactive tool to analyze three RCTs with respect to type-2 diabetes and hypertension target populations in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

ResultsWe demonstrate how the proposed metrics and associated statistics enable users to rapidly examine representativeness of all subpopulations in the RCT defined by a set of categorical traits (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity, smoker status, and blood pressure) with respect to target populations.

DiscussionThe normalized metrics provide an intuitive standardized scale for evaluating representation across subgroups, which may have vastly different enrollment fractions and rates in RCT study cohorts. The metrics are beneficial complements to other approaches (e.g., enrollment fractions and GIST) used to identify generalizability and health equity of RCTs.

ConclusionBy quantifying the gaps between RCT and target populations, the proposed methods can support generalizability evaluation of existing RCT cohorts, enrollment target decisions for new RCTs, and monitoring of RCT recruitment, ultimately contributing to more equitable public health outcomes.",NA,medrxiv

A better understanding of how these factors interact can help us to design early health prevention and control strategies, and develop better predictive models for public health risk management of SARS-CoV-2. This study examines the associations between COVID-19 epidemic growth and macro-level determinants of transmission such as climate, socio-economic factors, demographic factors, and population health, during the first wave of outbreaks in the United States.

MethodsA spatial-temporal data-set was created by collating information from a variety of data sources including the Johns Hopkins Universitys Centre for Systems Science and Engineering, the United States Census Bureau, the USDA Economic Research Service, the United States EPA, the National Climatic Data Center, the CDC and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). A unique data-driven study design was implemented that allows us to assess the relationship between COVID-19 case and death epidemic doubling times and explanatory variables using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM).

ResultsThe main factors associated with case doubling times are higher population density, home overcrowding, manufacturing, and recreation industries. Poverty was also an important predictor of faster epidemic growth perhaps because of factors associated with in-work poverty-related conditions, although poverty is also a predictor of poor population health which is likely driving case and death reporting. Air pollution and diabetes were other important drivers of case reporting. Warmer temperatures are associated with slower epidemic growth, which is most likely explained by human behaviors associated with warmer locations i.e ventilating homes and workplaces. and socializing outdoors. The main factors associated with death doubling times were population density, poverty older age, diabetes, and air pollution. Temperature was also slightly significant slowing death doubling times.

ConclusionsSuch findings help underpin current understanding of the disease epidemiology and also supports current policy and advice recommending ventilation of homes, work-spaces, and schools, along with social distancing and mask-wearing. The results also suggest that states which adopted more stringent containment measures early on did have some success suppressing the virus. We can presume that if this was replicated at a federal level, much better outcomes would have been observed across the United States.",NA,medrxiv

However, unexpectedly low cumulative incidence, low infection-fatality rate, and mild COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were frequently reported in PAD. The discrepancy between clinical evidence and impaired antibody production requires in-depth studies on patients immune responses.

MethodsForty-one patients with Common Variable Immune Deficiencies (CVID), 6 patients with X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and 28 healthy age-matched controls (HD) were analyzed for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibody production, generation of low and high affinity Spike-specific memory B-cells, Spike-specific T-cells before and one week after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine.

ResultsHD produced antibodies, and generated memory B-cells with high affinity for Trimeric Spike. In CVID, the vaccine induced poor Spike-specific antibodies, and atypical B-cells with low affinity for Trimeric Spike, possibly by extra-follicular reactions or incomplete germinal center reactions. In HD, among Spike positive memory B-cells, we identified receptor-binding-domain-specific cells that were undetectable in CVID, indicating the incapability to generate this new specificity. Specific T-cell responses toward Spike-protein were evident in HD and defective in CVID. Due to the absence of B-cells, patients with XLA responded to immunization by specific T-cell responses only.

ConclusionsWe present detailed data on early non-canonical immune responses in PAD to a vaccine against an antigen never encountered before by humans.

We investigate the disease triangle (intersection of pathogen, host, and environment) of Vf in Northern Arizona, where the risk of acquiring the disease is lower but prevalent and rising. We inspect reported and hospitalized cases of VF hosts. Then assess pathogen origin by comparing Northern Arizona clinical isolates to isolates from other regions. Lastly, we survey Northern Arizona soils for evidence of Coccidioides. We found that cases of Vf are increasing some requiring hospitalization.

Our objectives were to assess the comparative effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of patient- and provider-targeted interventions for improving shared decision-making about contraceptive methods in a pragmatic trial that prioritised applicability to real-world care.

DesignThe study design was a 2x2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial with four arms: (1) video + prompt card ( video), (2) decision aids + training ( decision aids), (3) dual interventions ( dual), and (4) usual care. Clusters were 16 primary and/or reproductive health care clinics that deliver contraceptive care in the Northeast United States.

ParticipantsParticipants were people who had completed a health care visit at a participating clinic, were assigned female sex at birth, were aged 15-49 years, were able to read and write English or Spanish, and had not previously participated in the study. Participants were enrolled for 13 weeks before interventions were implemented in clinics (pre-implementation cohort) and for 26 weeks after interventions were implemented in clinics (post-implementation cohort). 5,018 participants provided data on at least one study outcome.

InterventionsInterventions were a video and prompt card that encourage patients to ask three specific questions in the health care visit and a suite of decision aids on contraceptive methods and training for providers in how to use them to facilitate shared decision-making with patients in the health care visit.

Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was shared decision-making about contraceptive methods. Secondary outcomes spanned psychological, behavioural, and health outcomes. All outcomes were patient-reported via surveys administered immediately, four weeks, and six months after the health care visit.

ResultsWe did not observe any between-arm difference in the differences in shared decision-making between the pre- and post-implementation cohorts for the sample as a whole (video vs. usual care: adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82 to 1.85), p=0.80; decision aids vs. usual care: AOR=1.47 (95% CI: 0.98 to 2.18), p=0.32; dual vs. video: AOR=0.95 (95% CI: 0.64 to 1.41), p=1.00; dual vs. decision aids: AOR=0.80 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.17), p=0.72) or for participants with adequate health literacy. Among participants with limited health literacy, the difference in shared decision-making between the pre- and post-implementation cohorts was different in the video arm from the usual care arm (AOR=2.40 (95% CI: 1.01 to 5.71), p=.047) and was also different in the decision aids arm from the usual care arm (AOR=2.65 (95% CI: 1.16 to 6.07), p=.021), however these differences were not robust to adjustment for multiple comparisons. There were no intervention effects on the secondary outcomes among all participants nor among prespecified subgroups. With respect to intervention feasibility, rates of participant-reported exposure to the relevant intervention components were 9.4% for the video arm, 31.5% for the decision aids arm, and 5.0% for the dual arm. All interventions were acceptable to most patients.

ConclusionsThe interventions studied are unlikely to have a meaningful population-wide impact on shared decision-making or other outcomes in real-world contraceptive care without additional strategies to promote and support implementation. Selective use of the interventions among patients with limited health literacy may be more promising and, if effective, could reduce disparities in shared decision-making.

Methods618 GBMSM/TP were recruited in Nairobi between May to December 2017 using respondent-driven sampling. Participants reported recent sexual behaviour, HIV testing and care receipt, and symptoms of STIs. Participants tested for HIV using Kenyan testing algorithms and GeneXpert methods, syphilis, viral hepatitis and ano-genital gonorrhoea and chlamydia. We assessed associations with HIV status and detectable HIV viral load using multivariable robust Poisson regression models.

Findings26.4% (286/618) were HIV positive of whom 76.5% were status aware, 65.3% were on ART, and 47.4% were virally suppressed (<50 copies/ml). Participants 18-22 years old were less likely to be status aware, be receiving ART or to have achieved viral suppression. Mean log viral load was 3.14 log higher in 18-22 year olds compared to older participants. Bacterial STIs were frequently detected at both urethral and rectal sites and a majority of infections at both sites were asymptomatic by self-report (rectal 82.2%, urethral 90.8%).

InterpretationEngagement in the HIV diagnosis and care cascade among GBMSM/TP in Kenya is markedly better than in most sub-Saharan African countries. However it falls short of achievements among the general population in the country and cascades achieved in GBMSM in high income settings. Young men and transgender persons who have sex with men are least well served by the current configuration of adult key population services, and programmes should identify and address the sexual, social and developmental needs of adolescent and young key populations",NA,medrxiv

Its impact on hospitalised patients is less well documented.

MethodsWe collected viral sequences and clinical data of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 and hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs), sampled 16/11/2020 - 10/01/2021, from eight hospitals participating in the COG-UK-HOCI study. Associations between the variant and the outcomes of all-cause mortality and intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission were evaluated using mixed effects Cox models adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities, care home residence, pregnancy and ethnicity.

ResultsSequences were obtained from 2341 inpatients (HOCI cases = 786) and analysis of clinical outcomes was carried out in 2147 inpatients with all data available. The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of B.1.1.7 compared to other lineages was 1.01 (95% CI 0.79-1.28, P=0.94) and for ITU admission was 1.01 (95% CI 0.75-1.37, P=0.96). Analysis of sex-specific effects of B.1.1.7 identified increased risk of mortality (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.95-1.78) and ITU admission (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.15-2.90) in females infected with the variant but not males (mortality HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.10; ITU HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52-1.04).

ConclusionsIn common with smaller studies of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 we did not find an overall increase in mortality or ITU admission associated with B.1.1.7 compared to other lineages. However, women with B.1.1.7 may be at an increased risk of admission to intensive care and at modestly increased risk of mortality.",NA,medrxiv

In this study, we developed a rapid and inexpensive RT- qPCR testing pipeline for population-level SARS-CoV-2 detection, and used this pipeline to establish a clinical laboratory dedicated to COVID-19 testing at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) with a processing capacity of 6,000 samples per day and next-day result turnaround times.

Methods and findingsUsing this pipeline, we screened 6,786 healthcare workers and first responders, and 21,220 students, faculty, and staff from UCSD. Additionally, we screened 6,031 preschool-grade 12 students and staff from public and private schools across San Diego County that remained fully or partially open for in-person teaching during the pandemic. Between April 17, 2020 and February 5, 2021, participants provided 161,582 nasal swabs that were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 752 positive tests were obtained, yielding a test positivity rate of 0.47%. While the presence of symptoms was significantly correlated with higher viral load, most of the COVID-19 positive participants who participated in symptom surveys were asymptomatic at the time of testing. The positivity rate among preschool-grade 12 schools that remained open for in-person teaching was similar to the positivity rate at UCSD and lower than that of San Diego County, with the children in private schools being less likely to test positive than the adults at these schools.

ConclusionsMost schools across the United States have been closed for in-person learning for much of the 2020-2021 school year, and their safe reopening is a national priority. However, as there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 currently available to the majority of school-aged children, the traditional strategies of mandatory masking, physical distancing, and repeated viral testing of students and staff remain key components of risk mitigation in these settings. The data presented here suggest that the safety measures and repeated testing actions taken by participating healthcare and educational facilities were effective in preventing outbreaks, and that a similar combination of risk-mitigation strategies and repeated testing may be successfully adopted by other healthcare and educational systems.",NA,medrxiv

Previously, we showed that pulmonary rehabilitation induced brain activity changes akin to those seen in exposure based cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) in other conditions. D-cycloserine is a partial NMDA-receptor agonist which has been shown to enhance CBT.

ObjectivesHere, we tested whether D-cycloserine would augment the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on activity in brain areas that process breathlessness expectation.

Methods72 participants with mild-to-moderate COPD were recruited to a double-blind experimental medicine study running parallel to a pulmonary rehabilitation course. Participants were randomised to 250mg D-cycloserine or matched placebo, administered 15-30 minutes prior to the first four sessions of pulmonary rehabilitation. Brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, self-report questionnaires and clinical measures of respiratory function were collected at three time points: before, during (2-3 weeks) and after pulmonary rehabilitation (6-8 weeks).

MeasurementsPrimary and secondary outcome measures were difference in mean and voxel-wise brain activity across key brain regions of interest. An exploratory analysis determined the interaction with breathlessness-anxiety.

Main resultsNo difference was observed in either primary or secondary outcome measures. However, in the exploratory analysis, D-cycloserine attenuated the relationship between brain activity and breathlessness-anxiety within prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus and precuneus.

ConclusionsThe observed effects suggest that D-cycloserine augments pulmonary rehabilitation by dampening reactivity to breathlessness cues in brain areas associated with breathlessness expectation and anxiety. This work highlights the opportunity to test brain-active drugs in the context of augmenting behavioural interventions.",NA,medrxiv

Recent reports suggest the growing trend in vaccine preferential bias in parts of the world but not much in Europe. The present paper aims to investigate the occurrence of COVID-19 vaccine preferential bias in Europe for effective vaccination planning and pandemic control.

MethodData on vaccine delivered and vaccination campaigns of the EU member states was collected from Eu center for disease control (EUCDC) on COVID-19 vaccination radar. The data was processed for analysis on MS excel and both descriptive and statistical analysis was done with IBMs SPSS version 21. Analysis was performed at 95% confidence interval and statistically significant difference was considered at p < 0.05.

ResultsWe observed statistically significantly lower vaccine uptake compared to the vaccine delivered doses in the present study (average at 62.678 +/-3.928%) (p< 0.05, CI = 95%). Great variances in uptake for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines (50.927 +/-4.626 %) compared to Pfizer-Biontech vaccine (86.285 +/- 2.1052 %) was observed compared to previous prospective study on the wiliness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in the region (75%).

In addition to a complex acute presentation that can affect multiple organ systems, there is mounting evidence of various persistent long-term sequelae. The worldwide scientific community is characterizing a diverse range of seemingly common long-term outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the underlying assumptions in these studies vary widely making comparisons difficult. Numerous publications describe the clinical manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC or ""long COVID""), but they are difficult to integrate because of heterogeneous methods and the lack of a standard for denoting the many phenotypic manifestations of long COVID.

ObservationsWe identified 303 articles published before April 29, 2021, curated 59 relevant manuscripts that described clinical manifestations in 81 cohorts of individuals three weeks or more following acute COVID-19, and mapped 287 unique clinical findings to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms.

Conclusions and RelevancePatients and clinicians often use different terms to describe the same symptom or condition. Addressing the heterogeneous and inconsistent language used to describe the clinical manifestations of long COVID combined with the lack of standardized terminologies for long COVID will provide a necessary foundation for comparison and meta-analysis of different studies. Translating long COVID manifestations into computable HPO terms will improve the analysis, data capture, and classification of long COVID patients. If researchers, clinicians, and patients share a common language, then studies can be compared or pooled more effectively. Furthermore, mapping lay terminology to HPO for long COVID manifestations will help patients assist clinicians and researchers in creating phenotypic characterizations that are computationally accessible, which may improve the stratification and thereby diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.",NA,medrxiv

Numerous epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have investigated the associations of DNA methylation at single CpG sites with childhood outcomes. However, the overall contribution of DNA methylation across the genome (R2Methylation) towards childhood phenotypes is unknown. An estimate of R2Methylation would provide context regarding the importance of DNA methylation explaining variance in health outcomes.

MethodsWe estimated the variance explained by epigenome-wide cord blood methylation (R2Methylation) for five childhood phenotypes: gestational age, birth weight, and body mass index (BMI), IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age. We adapted a genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) approach with cross-validation (CV) to DNA methylation data and applied it in two population-based birth cohorts: ALSPAC (n=775) and Generation R (n=1382).

ResultsUsing information from >470,000 autosomal probes we estimated that DNA methylation at birth explains 45% (SDCV = 0.07) of gestational age variance and 16% (SDCV = 0.05) of birth weight variance. The R2Methylation estimates for BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age estimates were near 0% across almost all cross-validation iterations.

ConclusionsThe results suggest that cord blood methylation explains a moderate to large degree of variance in gestational age and birth weight, in line with the success of previous EWAS in identifying numerous CpG sites associated with these phenotypes. In contrast, we could not obtain a reliable estimate for school-age BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms. This may reflect a null bias due to insufficient sample size to detect variance explained in more weakly associated phenotypes, although the true R2Methylation for these phenotypes is likely below that of gestational age and birth weight when using DNA methylation at birth.",NA,medrxiv

With the aging of the global population, the prevalence of these diseases is projected to increase, leading to reduced quality of life and increased healthcare cost. In the following, we built an eye age predictor by training convolutional neural networks to predict age from 175,000 eye fundus and optical coherence tomography images (R-Squared=83.6+-0.6%; root mean squared error=3.34+-0.07 years). We used attention maps to identify the features driving the eye age prediction. We defined accelerated eye aging as the difference between eye age and chronological age and performed a genome wide association study [GWAS] on this phenotype. Accelerated eye aging is 28.2+-1.2% GWAS-heritable, and is associated with 255 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 122 genes (e.g HERC2, associated with eye pigmentation). Similarly, we identified biomarkers (e.g blood pressure), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g cataract), environmental variables (e.g sleep deprivation) and socioeconomic variables (e.g income) associated with our newly defined phenotype. Our predictor could be used to detect premature eye aging in patients, and to evaluate the effect of emerging rejuvenation therapies on eye health.",NA,medrxiv

For example, liver volume declines, fatty replacement increases in the pancreas, and patients become more vulnerable to age-related diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, type two diabetes, cancer, gallstones and inflammatory pancreatic disease. Detecting early abdominal aging and identifying factors associated with this phenotype could help delay the onset of such diseases. In the following, we built the first abdominal age predictor by training convolutional neural networks to predict age from 45,552 liver magnetic resonance images [MRIs] and 36,784 pancreas MRIs (R-Squared=73.3{+/-}0.6; root mean squared error=3.70{+/-}0.03). Attention maps show that the prediction is driven not only by liver and pancreas anatomical features, but also by surrounding organs and tissue. We defined accelerated abdominal aging as the difference between abdominal age and chronological age, a phenotype which we found to be partially heritable (h_g2=26.3{+/-}1.9%). Accelerated abdominal aging is associated with seven single nucleotide polymorphisms in six genes (e.g PNPT1, involved in RNA metabolic processes). Similarly, it is associated with biomarkers (e.g body impedance), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking) and socioeconomic (e.g education) variables, suggesting potential therapeutic and lifestyle interventions to slow abdominal aging.

Results & conclusionAntibiotics reduced the abundance and functional subsystems of each samples microbiota from baseline until day 7, when persistent, tolerant, and resistant microbiota, including fungi, grew back again. Variations in microbiota abundance and diversity were patient-specific. Closer microbiome network relationships observed in baseline samples reduced until day 7, when it became closer again. Bacterial microbiota networks and spatial ordination relationships were closer than that of other kingdoms. Actinobacteria phylum and Mycobacterium were more affected by antibiotics than other phyla and genera. Parasites, viruses, and fungi were less affected by antibiotics than bacteria in a descending order. Resistance genes/mechanisms to important antibiotics, plasmids, transposons, insertion sequences, integrative conjugative elements were identified in few samples.

MinION can be adopted clinically to monitor treatment and consequent dysbiosis, and identify both known and unknown pathogens and resistance genes to inform tailored treatment choices, specifically in TB.

Author summaryTuberculosis (TB), one of the major killers of mankind, continually remains elusive as challenges with early diagnosis and treatment monitoring remain. Herein, we use a single portable sequencer from Oxford Nanopore, the minION, to diagnose TB and monitor its treatment with antibiotics using routine sputum samples. In addition, the presence of other pathogens, important commensals, antibiotic resistance genes, mobile genetic elements, and the effect of the antibiotic treatment on the sputum microbiota were determined from the same data. This makes the minION an important tool that can be used in clinical laboratories to obtain data that can inform live-saving decisions.",NA,medrxiv

Materials and methodsIt was a randomized, prospective, two-stage study conducted on a social media website (i.e., the Instagram platform). At Stage 1 Save Your Heart online school was announced, and 945 applicants were registered for the training. The online training programme included the following modules: Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), Heart-Healthy Diet, Cholesterol. What a Patient Needs to Know, Physical Activity for the Prevention of CVDs, Overweight and Obesity, Smoking as a Risk Factor for CVDs, Hypertension: Diagnosis, Hypertension: Treatment, Myocardial Infarction: Diagnosis and Treatment. At Stage 2 a total of 125 participants were randomly selected and assigned into one of the four training groups depending on the training mode, i.e. text posts of up to 4.000 characters, short video clips of up to 5 minutes, text posts followed by video clips or video clips followed by text posts in Group 1 (n=31), Group 2 (n=31), Group 3 (n=33) and Group 4 (n=30), respectively. Before and after training respondents in all the four groups completed the Heart Disease Knowledge Questionnaire (HDKQ).

ResultsThe total number of people who listened to and read the materials of the online school was 2.108 people; the overall engagement (comments, shares and saves) was 1.598 people. The average percentage viewed was 22%. The online school audience was mostly female (84%). A total of 80.8% of participants had post-secondary education. The mean duration of hypertension was 6.1 years. Smokers accounted for 3.2% of the respondents. Before training the number of correct responses for 29 HDKQ statements was 18.4 (CI, 17.5;19.4), with no significant differences between the groups. After training the number of correct responses increased to 21.9 (CI, 21;22.7) (p (ANOVA) <0.0001). The post-hoc analysis showed that after training the respondents from Group 3 gave the lowest number of correct responses compared to Groups 1 and 2, i.e. {Delta}=4.9 (CI, -7.8;2.0) and {Delta}=3.7 (CI, -6.5;-0.8), respectively. Participants from Group 4 had more correct responses than the respondents in Group 3, i.e. {Delta}=5.2 (CI, 2.2;8.1). The regression analysis showed that the post-training number of correct responses in Group 4 increased on average by 3.9 compared to Group 3 ({beta}=3.94 p=0.04 (CI, 0.21;7.66)). The study showed a significant association between the duration of hypertension and the number of correct responses both before and after training ({beta}=0.20 p=0.007 (CI, 0.06;0.34) and {beta}=0.16 p=0.005 (CI, 0.05;0.27), respectively). No association was found between gender, age, education and the number of correct responses both before and after training.

ConclusionsIn all the 4 groups there was a tendency to increase in the number of correct responses after training, but among the training modes the most effective method of informing people about the primary prevention of hypertension using a social media website corresponded to the following sequence: a video clip of up to 5 minutes followed by a text post of up to 4,000 characters. Participants in Group 3 who received the material in the form of text posts followed by video clips gave the lowest number of correct responses for HDKQ statements after training. The results of this study can be used to design online training programmes for the primary prevention of hypertension.",NA,medrxiv

While genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic loci associated with cardiovascular diseases, exact genes driving these associations remain mostly uncovered. Due to Finlands population history, many deleterious and high-impact variants are enriched in the Finnish population giving a possibility to find genetic associations for protein-truncating variants that likely tie the association to a gene and that would not be detected elsewhere.

In FinnGen, a large Finnish biobank study, we identified an inframe insertion rs534125149 in MFGE8 to have protective effect against coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.75, p = 2.63x10-16) and related endpoints. This variant is highly enriched in Finland (70-fold compared to Non-Finnish Europeans) with allele frequency of 3% in Finland. The protective association was replicated in meta-analysis of biobanks of Japan and Estonian (OR = 0.75, p = 5.41x10-7).

Additionally, we identified a splice acceptor variant rs201988637 in MFGE8, independent of the rs534125149 and similarly protective in relation to coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.72, p = 7.94x10-06) and related endpoints, with no significant risk-increasing associations. The protein-truncating variant was also associated with lower pulse pressure, pointing towards a function of MFGE8 in arterial stiffness and aging also in humans in addition to previous evidence in mice. In conclusion, our results show that inhibiting the production of lactadherin could lower the risk for coronary heart disease substantially.",NA,medrxiv

DesignObservational cohort study

SettingCommunity telephone triage in the Yorkshire and Humber, Bassetlaw, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire region.

Participants40, 261 adults who contacted NHS 111 telephone triage services provided by Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust between the 18th March 2020 and 29th June 2020 with symptoms indicating possible COVID-19 infection were linked to Office for National Statistics death registration data, hospital and general practice electronic health care data collected by NHS Digital.

OutcomeAccuracy of triage disposition (self-care/non-urgent clinical assessment versus ambulance dispatch/urgent clinical assessment) was assessed in terms of death or need for organ support at 30, 7 and 3 days from first contact with the telephone triage service.

ResultsCallers had a 3% (1, 200/40, 261) risk of adverse outcome. Telephone triage recommended self-care or non-urgent assessment for 60% (24, 335/40, 261), with a 1.3% (310/24, 335) risk of subsequent adverse outcome. Telephone triage had 74.2% sensitivity (95% CI: 71.6 to 76.6%) and 61.5% specificity (61% to 62%) for adverse outcomes at 30 days from first contact. Multivariable analysis suggested some co-morbidities (such as chronic respiratory disease) may be over-estimated as predictors of adverse outcome, while the association of diabetes with adverse outcome may be under-estimated. Repeat contact with the service appears to be an important under recognised predictor of adverse outcomes with both 2 contacts (OR 1.77 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.75) and 3 or more contacts (OR 4.02 95% CI: 1.68 to 9.65) associated with clinical deterioration when not provided with an ambulance or urgent clinical assessment.

ConclusionPatients advised to self-care or receive non-urgent clinical assessment had a small but non-negligible risk of serious clinical deterioration. The sensitivity and specificity of telephone triage was comparable to other tools used to triage patient acuity in emergency and urgent care. Repeat contact with telephone services needs recognition as an important predictor of subsequent adverse outcomes.

What is already known on this topicO_LITelephone triage has been used to divert patients with suspected COVID-19 to self care or for non-urgent clinical assessments, and thereby help mitigate the risk of health services being overwhelmed by patients who require no speficic treatment.

Five sampling points from three rivers (AR-1 and AR-2 in Arenales River, MR-1 and MR-2 in Mojotoro River, and CR in La Caldera River) from the Province of Salta (Argentina), two of them receiving the discharges of the wastewater plants (WWTP) of the city of Salta, were monitored from July to December 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19. Fifteen water samples from each point (75 samples in total) were collected and characterized physico-chemically and microbiologically and SARS-CoV-2 was quantitatively detected by RT-qPCR. In addition, two targets linked to human contributions, human polyomavirus (HPyV) and RNase P, were quantified and used to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 concentration, which was ultimately compared to the active reported COVID-19 cases. Statistical analyses allowed us to verify the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), as well as to find similarities and differences between sampling points. La Caldera River showed the best water quality, and FIB were within acceptable limits for recreational activities. Although Mojotoro River receives the discharge of the northern WWTP of the city, it did not affect the water quality. Instead, the Arenales River presented the poorest water quality and the river at AR-2 was negatively affected by the discharges of the southern WWTP, which contributed to the significant increase of fecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 was only found in about half of the samples and in low concentrations in La Caldera and Mojotoro Rivers, while it was high and persistent in the Arenales River. None of the two human tracers was detected in CR, only HPyV was found in MR-1, MR-2 and AR-1, and both were quantified in AR-2. The experimental and the normalized (using the two tracers) viral concentrations strongly correlated with the curve of active reported COVID-19 cases; thus, the Arenales River at AR-2 reflected the epidemiological situation of the city. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that showed the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 concentration in an urban river highly impacted by wastewater and proved that can be used for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to support health authorities.",NA,medrxiv

Anxiety related to infection, stress and stigma caused by the forced changes in daily life have reportedly increased the incidence and symptoms of depression, anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Under such circumstances, telepsychiatry is gaining importance and attracting a great deal of attention. However, few large pragmatic clinical trials on the use of telepsychiatry targeting multiple psychiatric disorders have been conducted to date.

MethodsThe targeted study cohort will consist of adults (>18 years) who meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for either (1) depressive disorders, (2) anxiety disorders, or (3) obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Patients will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a ""telepsychiatry group"" (at least 50% of visits to be conducted using telemedicine, with at least one face-to-face treatment [FTF] every six months) or an ""FTF group"" (all visits to be conducted FTF, with no telemedicine). Both groups will receive the usual treatment covered by public medical insurance. The study will utilize a master protocol design in that there will be primary and secondary outcomes for the entire group regardless of diagnosis, as well as the outcomes for each individual disorder group.

DiscussionThis study will be a non-inferiority trial to test that the treatment effect of telepsychiatry is not inferior to that of FTF alone. This study will provide useful insights into the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of psychiatry.

However, the scale-up of the vaccine is likely to be hindered by the widespread social media misinformation. We, therefore, conducted a study to assess the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Zimbabweans.

MethodsWe conducted a descriptive online cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire among adults. The questionnaire assessed willingness to be vaccinated; socio-demographic characteristics, individual attitudes and perceptions, effectiveness, and safety of the vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the independent factors associated with vaccine uptake.

ResultsWe analysed data for 1168 participants, age range of 19-89 years with the majority being females (57.5%). Half (49.9%) of the participants reported that they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine. The majority were uncertain about the effectiveness of the vaccine (76.0%) and its safety (55.0%). About half lacked trust in the governments ability to ensure the availability of an effective vaccine and 61.0% mentioned that they would seek advice from a healthcare worker to vaccinate.

ResultsBefore feature selection, Cox performed similarly to DeepSurv, achieving a c-index of 0.771 (95% CI 0.770-0.772) and 0.774 (95% CI 0.772-0.775) on the test dataset, respectively. Using the selected 34 features, the c-index of Cox decreased slightly to 0.770 (95% CI 0.769-0.770) and DeepSurv to 0.758 (95% CI 0.755-0.762). The models show excellent calibration at 10 years.

ConclusionsThis study improves on a previous smartphone-compatible score, C-Score, by incorporating non-modifiable factors in addition to variables which can be actively modified to reduce risk. This score is comprehensive, easily interpretable and actionable, and as such, could provide a powerful tool for preventative healthcare.",NA,medrxiv

Studies published to date have investigated the initial months following the onset of the pandemic, despite national and regional restrictions persisting to Summer 2021.

MethodsWe conducted a descriptive time series analysis utilising data from the Greater Manchester Care Record, which contains de-identified, primary care health records of 2.8 million patients. Counts of incident and all episodes of self-harm recorded between 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021 were made for all patients, with stratification by sex, age group, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation (IMD) quintile and examination of overall differences by national and regional restriction phases.

FindingsBetween 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021, 33,444 episodes of self-harm by 13,148 individuals were recorded. Frequency ratios of incident and all episodes of self-harm were 0.59 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.69) and 0.69 (CI 0.63 to 0.75) respectively in April 2020 compared to February 2020. Between August 2020 and May 2021 frequency ratios were 0.92 (CI 0.88 to 0.96) for incident episodes and 0.86 (CI 0.84 to 0.88) for all episodes compared to the same months in 2019. Reductions were largest among men and people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods. An increase in all-episode self-harm (frequency ratio 1.09, CI 1.03 to 1.16) was observed for adolescents aged 10-17 between August 2020 and May 2021.

InterpretationThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a sustained impact on help seeking for self-harm. Reductions in primary care recorded self-harm have implications for clinicians ability to assess the needs and risks of individuals. Some patients may be experiencing prolonged untreated deterioration in their mental health while other groups are presenting in higher numbers. Our findings have important implications for primary care and mental health services in manging ongoing demand.

The objectives of the study were to measure antibody responses, levels, and neutralization capability after COVID-19 vaccination among immunocompromised patients and compare these variables to those of immunocompetent healthcare workers.

MethodsThis is an interim analysis of an ongoing observational, prospective cohort study which launched on April 14, 2021 across Western Pennsylvania. Participants were healthy healthcare workers (HCW) and immunocompromised patients who had completed their COVID-19 vaccination series. Individuals with a history of COVID-19 were not eligible. Serum was collected to measure for the presence of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using a semi-quantitative assay; antibody levels were available for comparisons. A quasi-random subset of patients was selected for pseudovirus neutralization assays. Seropositivity with 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals and distribution of antibody levels were measured. To identify risk factors for seronegativity, clinical characteristics were univariately compared between antibody reactive and non-reactive individuals within the immunocompromised group.

Results107 HCW and 489 immunocompromised patients were enrolled. Compared to HCWs, seropositivity was significantly lower (p<.001) among immunocompromised patients with Solid organ transplant (SOT), autoimmune, hematological malignancies, and solid tumors (HCW=98.1%; SOT=37.2%; autoimmune=83.8%; hematological malignancies=54.7%; and solid tumor=82.4%, p < 0.05). Over 94% of patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus were seropositive. Among seropositive patients, antibody levels were much lower among SOT (4.5 [2.1,13.1], p=.020). Neutralization titers tightly correlated with antibody levels (Spearman r = 0.91, p < 0.0001).

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of the humoral immune response to COVID-19 vaccines based on underlying immunosuppressive condition and highlight an urgent need to optimize and individualize COVID-19 prevention in these patients. These findings also have implications on public health guidance, particularly given revised Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations permitting vaccinated individuals to abandon masking and social distancing in most settings.

The gold standard diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection is a reverse transcription/quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) which targets the viral genome, an assay that has now been performed on millions of patient specimens worldwide regardless of symptomatic status. Recently Zhang et al. suggested the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 N gene could integrate into host cell DNA through the action of the LINE-1 retrotransposon, a mobile element that is potentially active in human somatic cells, thereby calling into question the veracity of N-gene based RT-qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, we assessed the potential impact of these purported integration events on nasal swab specimens tested at our clinical laboratory. Using an N-gene based RT-qPCR assay, we tested 768 arbitrarily selected specimens and identified 2 samples which resulted in a positive detection of viral sequence in the absence of reverse transcriptase, a necessary but not sufficient signal consistent with possible integration of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene into the host genome. Regardless of possible viral N gene integration into the genome, in this small subset of samples, all patients were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as indicated by a much lower Ct value for reactions performed in the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT) versus reactions performed without RT. Moreover, one of the two positives observed in the absence of RT also tested positive when using primers targeting ORF1ab, a gene closer to the 5 end of the genome. These data are inconsistent with the N gene integration hypothesis suggested by the studies by Zhang et al., and importantly, our results suggest little to no practical impact of possible SARS-CoV-2 genome integration events on RT-qPCR testing.

The location and size of focal lesions are only moderately predictive of the diverse cognitive outcome and rehabilitation potential after stroke. One explanation building on recent work on brain networks proposes that the cognitive consequences of focal lesions are strongly associated with perturbations of anatomically distributed brain networks supporting cognitive operations. To investigate the association between post-stroke structural disconnection and cognitive performance, we estimated individual level whole-brain disconnectivity probability maps using lesion maps from 102 stroke patients. Cognitive performance was assessed in the whole sample using Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and a more comprehensive computerized test protocol was performed on a subset (n=82). Multivariate analysis using Partial Least Squares revealed that higher disconnectivity in insular and frontal operculum was associated with poorer MoCA performance, indicating that lesions disconnecting these brain regions are more likely to be associated with global cognitive impairment. Furthermore, our results indicated that disconnection of the inferior frontal gyrus and the frontal orbital cortex is associated with poorer outcome across multiple cognitive domains. These findings demonstrate that the extent and distribution of the brain disconnectome in persons living with stroke sequelae are sensitive to cognitive deficits and support that longitudinal studies assessing the predictive value of brain network connectivity for cognitive outcome following stroke are warranted.",NA,medrxiv

To identify changes that could distinguish leukemic from normal precursor B-cells, we performed integrated multi-omics on primary patient samples. MLL-r cells feature an extensive remodelling of their glycoprotein glycocalyx, with increased Core 2-type O-glycans and complex N-glycans as well as significant changes in sialylation and fucosylation levels. Notably, a glycosaminoglycan remodelling from chondroitin sulfate to heparan sulfate was also observed. A survival screen to determine if glycan remodelling enzymes are redundant identified MGAT1 and NGLY1, components of the N-glycosylation/degradation pathway, as essential. OGT and OGA, unique enzymes that regulate intracellular O-GlcNAcylation, were also indispensable. Transcriptomics and proteomics further identified Fes and GALNT7-mediated glycosylation as possible therapeutic targets. Finally, next to well-known MLL-r pre-B ALL glycoprotein markers, our integrated multi-omics workflow identified previously unidentified diagnostic/therapeutic protein candidates.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMLL-r is a poor-prognosis subtype of pre-B ALL, usually studied using genome- and transcriptome-centric approaches. MLL-r has one of the lowest survival rates in adults as well as children diagnosed with leukemia, as the majority of treatments available are least effective against this subtype. We performed the first multi-omics evaluation of primary MLL-r patient cells integrating glycome, proteome and transcriptome datasets. This enabled us to uncover that MLL-r cells undergo an extensive remodelling of the glycocalyx that differs to the one of normal pre-B cells in particular in cell surface glycoproteins, the O-glycome and proteoglycome.

The exact reproduction number Rt for these VOCs is important to determine appropriate control measures. Here, we estimated the transmissibility for VOCs and lineages of SAR-CoV-2 based on genomic data and Bayesian inference under an epidemiological model to infer the reproduction number (Rt). We analyzed data for multiple VOCs from the same time period and countries, in order to compare their transmissibility while controlling for geographical and temporal factors. The lineage B had a significantly higher transmissibility than lineage A, and contributed to the global pandemic to a large extent. In addition, all VOCs had increased transmissibility when compared with other lineages in each country, indicating they are harder to control and present a high risk to public health. All countries should formulate specific prevention and control policies for these VOCs when they are detected to curve their potential for large-scale spread.",NA,medrxiv

Non-invasive sampling of exhaled breath contains metabolic markers indicative of underlying systemic metabolic abnormality.

MethodIn this pilot study, we implemented a non-invasive breathomics approach, combined with random forest machine learning, to investigate metabolic markers from pre-diabetic Hispanic adolescents with obesity as indicators of abnormal metabolic regulation.

FindingsExhaled breath collection using the ReCIVA breathalyzer is feasible in an adolescent population. We have identified a signature of breath metabolites (breath-IR model) which correlates with Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (R = 0.95, p <0.001). A strong correlation was also observed between the breath-IR model and the blood glycemic profile (fasting insulin R=0.91, p <0.001 and fasting glucose R=0.80, p <0.001). Among tentatively identified metabolites, limonene, undecane, and 2,7-dimethyl-undecane, significantly cluster individuals based on HOMA-IR (p =0.003, p =0.002, and p<0.001, respectively). Our breath-IR model differentiates between adolescents with and without IR with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87, after cross-validation.

InterpretationIdentification of a breath metabolite signature indicative of IR in prediabetic Hispanic adolescents with obesity provides evidence of the utility of exhaled breath metabolomics for assessing systemic metabolic dysregulation. A simple and non-invasive breath-based test has utility as a diagnostic tool for monitoring IR progression, potentially allowing for earlier detection of IR and implementation of early interventions to prevent onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

We aimed to test their potential to improve risk assessment and 2-week-wait referral decisions.

Methods157 GPs were presented with 23 vignettes describing patients with possible colorectal cancer symptoms. GPs gave their intuitive risk estimate and inclination to refer. They then saw the risk score of an algorithm (QCancer was not named) and could update their responses. Half of the sample was given information about the algorithms derivation, validation, and accuracy. At the end, we measured their algorithm disposition.

ResultsGPs changed their inclination to refer 26% of the time and switched decisions entirely 3% of the time. Post-algorithm decisions improved significantly vis-a-vis the 3% NICE threshold (OR 1.45 [1.27, 1.65], p<.001). The algorithms impact was greater where GPs had underestimated risk. GPs who received information about the algorithm had more positive disposition towards it. A learning effect was observed: GPs intuitive risk estimates became better calibrated over time, i.e., moved closer to QCancer.

ConclusionsCancer risk calculators have the potential to improve 2-week-wait referral decisions. Their use as learning tools to improve intuitive risk estimates is promising and should be further investigated.",NA,medrxiv

However, there have been concerns about an alarming decline in vaccinations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe performed a rapid review for studies that assessed childhood vaccination uptake during restrictive phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsWe found 35 published studies that compared changes in the pattern of childhood vaccinations before and during the pandemic. Thirteen were surveys; two mixed-methods surveys and interviews, three modelling studies and 17 retrospective cohort studies with historical controls. We also included ten reports by national or international agencies that had original data on vaccination uptake. Significant global disruptions to vaccine services were reported in Africa, Asia, America (including Latin America and the Caribbean) and Europe. We also found evidence of significant disruption to vaccine uptake for diphtheria tetanus pertussis, BCG, measles and polio. Countries where vaccination rates were already suboptimal had greater drops in uptake and there was evidence of smaller declines in younger children compared to older children. Children born to women who could not read and write were more likely to be incompletely immunized. Various initiatives were used to drive up vaccination rates post restrictions.

Ultra-high field (UHF) MRI at 7T and above provides technological advances suited to optimize the detection of cortical lesions in MS.

PurposeTo provide a narrative and quantitative systematic review of the literature on UHF MRI of cortical lesions in MS.

MethodsA systematic search of all literature on UHF MRI of cortical lesions in MS published before September 2020. Quantitative outcome measures included cortical lesion numbers reported using 3T and 7T MRI and between 7T MRI sequences, along with sensitivity of UHF MRI towards cortical lesions verified by histopathology.

Results7T MRI detected on average 52{+/-}26% (mean {+/-} 95% confidence interval) more cortical lesions than the best performing image contrast at 3T, with the largest increase in type II-IV intracortical lesion detection. Across all studies, the mean cortical lesion number was 17{+/-}6/patient. In progressive MS cohorts, approximately four times more cortical lesions were reported than in CIS/early RRMS, and RRMS. Superiority of one MRI sequence over another could not be established from available data. Post-mortem lesion detection with UHF MRI agreed only modestly with pathological examinations. Mean pro- and retrospective sensitivity was 33{+/-}6% and 71{+/-}10%, respectively, with the highest sensitivity towards type I and type IV lesions.

ConclusionUHF MRI improves cortical lesion detection in MS considerably compared to 3T MRI, particularly for type II-IV lesions. Despite modest sensitivity, 7T MRI is still capable of visualizing all aspects of cortical lesion pathology and could potentially aid clinicians in diagnosing and monitoring MS, and progressive MS in particular.

RESEARCH QUESTIONWhat is the influence of genetic ancestry on the fit of the guideline-recommended racial/ethnic-based spirometry reference equations in populations of genetically admixed children?

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSCross-sectional fit of guideline-recommended racial/ethnic-based spirometry reference equations was evaluated in control subjects from case-control studies of asthma. Anthropometry, blood samples, and spirometric measurements were obtained in 599 healthy admixed children, aged 8 to 21-years. Genetic ancestry was estimated using genome-wide genotype data. Equation fit was determined as a mean z-score between -0.5 and 0.5 and assessed in self-identified African American (N = 275) and Puerto Rican (N = 324) children using the distribution to determine cut points of genetic ancestry.

RESULTSFor African American children, African American-derived equations fit for predicting FEV1 and FVC in those with an African ancestry above the median (81-100%), whereas composite equations for ""other/mixed"" populations fit for predicting FEV1 and FVC in those with an African ancestry below the median (31-81%). Among Puerto Rican children, White-derived equations fit for predicting FEV1, and the composite equations fit for predicting FVC for those with African ancestry above the median (21-88%). In contrast, in Puerto Rican children with African ancestry below the median (6-21%), only equations derived in Whites provide an adequate fit.

INTERPRETATIONGuideline-recommended spirometry reference equations yielded biased estimates of lung function in admixed populations with high variation of African ancestry. Spirometry is due for reference equations that incorporate genetic ancestry, either for more precise application of the current equations or the derivation and utilization of new equations.",NA,medrxiv

Little is known, however, about the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced responses in immunosuppressed patients. We investigated induction of antigen-specific antibody, B cell and T cell responses in patients with multiple sclerosis on anti-CD20 (MS-aCD20) monotherapy following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Treatment with aCD20 significantly reduced Spike and RBD specific antibody and memory B cell responses in most patients, an effect that was ameliorated with longer duration from last aCD20 treatment and extent of B cell reconstitution. In contrast, all MS-aCD20 patients generated antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses following vaccination. However, treatment with aCD20 skewed these responses compromising circulating Tfh responses and augmenting CD8 T cell induction, while largely preserving Th1 priming. These data also revealed underlying features of coordinated immune responses following mRNA vaccination. Specifically, the MS-aCD20 patients who failed to generate anti-RBD IgG had the most severe defect in cTfh cell responses and more robust CD8 T cell responses compared to those who generated anti-RBD IgG, whose T cell responses were more similar to healthy controls.

The functional changes in PD are particularly prominent in terms of oscillatory neuronal activity in the characteristic sensorimotor alpha and beta rhythms. However, summaries in terms of alpha or beta power do not capture the full range of the complex dynamic nature of the signals from the somatosensory cortex. This raises the question of how to quantify and summarise the functional changes in such oscillatory features in a manner that captures the relevant disease- and symptom-related neural activity.

We investigated the role of spontaneous cortical somatosensory activity in the electrophysiological alpha and beta bands among a cohort of early- to mid-stage PD patients (N=78) and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (N=60) using source reconstructed resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We quantified the oscillatory features of the neural time series by its oscillatory alpha power, beta power, and 1/f broadband characteristics using power spectral density, and additionally by characterising ""burst"" properties in the signals. We examined the relationship between the signal features and disease state, age, sex, and cortical thickness. Using multiple regression, we examined the relative contribution of the oscillatory features on the clinical manifestation of motor symptoms in the PD group.

Our results show that PD patients differ from healthy controls on several of the oscillatory features, showing higher beta-band power, higher burst amplitude, and steeper 1/f broadband characteristics compared to healthy controls, as well as a steeper age-related decrease in the bursts rate. While there was a high degree of correlation between some of the oscillatory features, several features also appeared functionally separated, showing independent feature-to-symptom relationships. For instance, oscillatory beta power increased with the severity of midline function symptoms, while burst rate decreased with the severity of bradykinesia.

Our study shows that quantification of distinct features within the oscillatory sensorimotor neural time series in PD captures different underlying mechanisms related to disease progression and symptom severity, which in turn has a potential for a more individualised and precision-based approach to assessing functional neural changes in PD.",NA,medrxiv

Here, we studied novelty-response mechanisms in Parkinsons disease (PD). In PD patient-volunteers, we recorded from cortical circuits with scalp-based electroencephalography (EEG) and from subcortical circuits using intraoperative neurophysiology during surgeries for implantation of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. We report three major results. First, novel auditory stimuli triggered midfrontal [~]4-Hz rhythms, which were attenuated in PD patients but were not linked with cognitive function or novelty-associated slowing. Second, 32% of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons were response-modulated; nearly all (94%) of these were also modulated by novel stimuli. Finally, response-modulated STN neurons were coherent with midfrontal low- frequency activity. These findings link scalp-based measurements of neural activity with neuronal activity in the STN. Our results provide insight into midfrontal cognitive control mechanisms and how hyperdirect circuits evaluate new information.

Significance statementParkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with motor and cognitive symptoms. Here we studied how the brain recruits cognitive control in response to new information. We found that PD patients have decreased cortical low-frequency oscillations linked to cognitive control. We also examined single neurons in PD patients in a deep brain structure called the subthalamic nucleus, and found that response-modulated neurons were uniquely modulated by novelty and they fired in-phase with these same low-frequency brain oscillations. Our work helps illustrate how neural circuits evaluate new information, which could be relevant for PD as well as other diseases that disrupt cognition.",NA,medrxiv

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases, as well as Google search engine, were inspected to find all implementations of BSC at HCOs until 20 September 2020. The Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed for each included article. The eligible studies were 33, in which 36 BSC implementations were identified. The categorization and re-grouping of the 797 KPIs resulted in 13 major-dimensions: The financial, efficiency and effectiveness, availability and quality of supplies and services, managerial tasks, Health Care Workers (HCWs) scientific development error-free and safety, the time, HCW-centeredness, patient-centeredness, technology and information system, community care and reputation, HCO building, and the communication. Under them, 45 sub-dimension were identified. The high RoB in most implementations was due to the selection bias. None of the 36 BSC implementations was utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review solves the dilemma of categorization differences among BSC implementations, which in turn will improve the data sharing and comparability among studies. A modification for the BSC design to include external and managerial perspectives is required. However, a lack of a comprehensive PE for HCOs during the pandemic was observed, so the resulted dimensions and KPIs are recommended for planning, monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement of HCOs. Many dimensions were negatively influenced by the pandemic. However, some dimensions still need further investigation. BSC dimensions have an essential role in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and will help the health care managers to mitigate its consequences on HCOs.",NA,medrxiv

Under all scenarios of immune evasion, we find an increased transmissibility advantage for B.1617.2 against all previously circulating strains. Using an extended SIR model accounting for reinfections and wanning immunity, we produce evidence in support of how early public interventions in March 2021 would have helped to control transmission in the country. We argue that enhanced genomic surveillance along with constant assessment of risk associated with increased transmission is critical for pandemic responsiveness.

This limits our ability to quantify the impact of interventions on viral transmission. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number. We then develop a model linking VL to infectiousness, showing that a persons infectiousness increases sub-linearly with VL. We show that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself. Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness, we further incorporated data on antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission. We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency; however, more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost, but with many more false-negative tests. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies.

Multiple objective techniques for peripheral nerve block have been discussed in the literature.

OBJECTIVEThis study aims to investigate whether perfusion index (PI), non-invasive tissue hemoglobin monitoring (SpHb), tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), tissue hemoglobin index (THI) and body temperature are reliable and objective methods to evaluate the adequacy of infraclavicular blockage.

DESIGNA prospective observational study.

SETTINGSingle center, Department of Anesthesiology, Harran University Medical Faculty, Turkey, from February 2019 to December 2019.

PATIENTSA total of 100 patients scheduled to undergo forearm surgery.

INTERVENTIONUltrasound-guided infraclavicular block (ICB) in 100 patients undergoing forearm surgery.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESPI, SpHb, StO2, THI and Body Temperature measurements were recorded 5 min before the block procedure, right after the procedure, and until the 25th minute after the procedure at 5-min intervals. These values were compared between the blocked limbs and non-blocked limbs while being statistically compared between the successful and failed block groups.

RESULTSAlthough there were significant differences between the groups of blocked extremity and non-blocked extremity in terms of StO2 (P = 0.001), THI (P = 0.001), PI (P = 0.001) and body temperature (P = 0.001), there was no significant difference between these groups in terms of SpHb (P > 0.05). Moreover, a significant difference was detected between the groups of successful block and failed block in terms of StO2 (P = 0.002), PI (P = 0.002) and body temperature (P = 0.005), while there was no significant difference between these groups in terms of THI (P > 0.05) and SpHb (P > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONStO2, PI and body temperature measurements are the simple, objective, noninvasive techniques to be used to evaluate success of block procedures. According to The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, StO2 is the specific parameter with the highest sensitivity among these parameters.

The demographic consequences of not measuring age correctly are manifold, including errors in mortality rates and population estimates, particularly at older ages. It also affects public programs because target populations depend on reliable population age distributions. In Brazil, the start of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 marked the collection of new administrative data. Every citizen must be registered and need to show an identity document to get vaccinated. The requirement of proof-of-age documentation provides a unique opportunity for measuring the elderly population using a different database. This article examines the reliability of age distributions of men and women 80 years and older. We calculate various demographic indicators using data from the vaccination registration system and compare them to those from the target population estimates of the National Vaccination Plan, censuses, and population projections for Brazil and countries with high-quality population data. We show that requiring proof-of-age, such as in the vaccination records, increases data quality, mainly through the reduction of age heaping and age exaggeration. However, I.D. cards cannot fully solve wrong birth dates that result from weak historical registration systems. Thus, one should be careful when using estimates of the old age population living in some of the Brazilian regions, particularly the North, Northeast, and Center-West. Also, our analysis reveals a mismatch between the projected population by age, sex, and region, which guided the vaccination plan, and the number of vaccinated at ages 80 and older. The methodology developed to adjust the mortality rates used in the demographic projections is probably the main factor behind the disparities found.",NA,medrxiv

Such studies attempt to capture population responses to differing levels of social distancing, and are used for designing policies which both inhibit disease spread but also allow for limited economic activity. One common criterion utilized for the recent pandemic is the peak of the infected population, a measure of the strain placed upon the health care system; protocols which reduce this peak are commonly said to  flatten the curve."" In this work, we consider a very specialized distancing mandate, which consists of one period of fixed length of distancing, and addresses the question of optimal initiation time. We prove rigorously that this time is characterized by an equal peaks phenomenon: the optimal protocol will experience a rebound in the infected peak after distancing is relaxed, which is equal in size to the peak when distancing is commenced. In the case of a non-perfect lockdown (i.e. disease transmission is not completely suppressed), explicit formulas for the initiation time cannot be computed, but implicit relations are provided which can be pre-computed given the current state of the epidemic. Expected extensions to more general distancing policies are also hypothesized, which suggest designs for the optimal timing of non-overlapping lockdowns.",NA,medrxiv

We collected information on potential confounders via questionnaire. Culture of participants stool samples was performed with ChromID(R)-ESBL agar plates and species identification with MALDI-TOF-MS. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC). Sensitivity analyses included stratification by country and interaction models using country as secondary exposure.

ResultsPrevalence of ESBL-EC was 11% (workers), 29% (nearby residents), and 7% (distant residents), and higher in Romania (28%) than in Germany (7%) and the Netherlands (6%).

Eligibility CriteriaCross-sectional studies, cohort studies, randomised control trials, and case-control studies with participant data concerning long COVID symptomatology or abnormal functioning.

Data ExtractionStudies were screened and assessed for risk of bias by two independent reviewers, with conflicts resolved with a third reviewer. The AXIS tool was utilised to appraise the quality of the evidence. Data were extracted and collated using a data extraction tool in Microsoft Excel.

ResultsOf the 1,145 studies screened, 39 were included, all describing adult cohorts with long COVID and sample sizes ranging from 32 to 1,733. Studies included data pertaining to symptomatology, pulmonary functioning, chest imaging, cognitive functioning, psychological disorder, and/or quality of life. Fatigue presented as the most prevalent symptom during both OSC and PCS at 43% and 44%, respectively. Sleep disorder (36%; 33%), dyspnoea (31%; 40%), and cough (26%; 22%) followed in prevalence. Abnormal spirometry (FEV1 <80% predicted) was observed in 15% and 11%, and abnormal chest imaging observed in 34% and 28%, respectively. Cognitive impairments were also evident (20%; 15%), as well as anxiety (28%; 34%) and depression (25%; 32%).

Tamoxifen is metabolized by CYP2D6 into its active metabolite, endoxifen, which has been known to play an important role in reducing risk of ER+ breast cancer recurrence. CYP2D6 is a highly polymorphic gene with more than 100 alleles. The phenotype of this gene is categorized into ultrarapid metabolizer (UM), normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and poor metabolizer (PM). Certain CYP2D6 polymorphisms may cause reduced activity of this enzyme. Studies have found that reduced CYP2D6 activity in IM and PM patients causes low efficacy of standard tamoxifen therapy. This study aims to observe the distribution of CYP2D6 alleles and its correlation with endoxifen levels in Indonesian ER+ breast cancer patients. 151 patients who have received tamoxifen therapy for at least eight weeks were recruited prospectively. DNA and blood samples were collected with buccal swab and finger-prick methods, respectively. Genotyping was performed using the qPCR method while metabolite level measurement was performed using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found that 40.67% of ER+ breast cancer patients recruited were IM.

The present study, where the fecal microbiome in a cohort of 380 children was characterized using 16s rDNA and metagenomic sequencing aimed to investigate the association between the microbiota and cognitive functioning of children at the age of 45 months measured with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III).

Overall the microbiome profile showed a significant association with cognitive functioning.

Follow-up mediation analyses revealed significant mediation effects of the level of this genus on the associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy and current maternal smoking with cognitive functioning. Metagenomic sequencing of a subset of these samples indicated that the identified genus was most closely related to Enterobacter asburiae.

Our results indicate that alteration of the gut microflora is associated with cognitive functioning in childhood.

In pregnant women, higher PF is associated with better maternal and fetal health, better delivery outcomes and earlier postpartum recovery. The assessment of PF during pregnancy requires special considerations to preserve fetal and maternal health; thus, providing a compilation of the most frequently used fitness tests, and assessing their validity, reliability, and association with maternal and neonatal health-related outcomes is of scientific and clinical interest.

ObjectivesTo systematically review studies evaluating one or more components of PF in pregnant women, to answer two research questions: 1) What fitness tests have been previously employed in pregnant women? and 2) What is the validity and reliability of these tests and their relationship with health-related outcomes?

Data SourcesPubMed and Web of Science.

MethodsTwo independent reviewers systematically examined the articles in each database. The information from the included articles was summarized by a single researcher.

ResultsA total of 149 articles containing a sum of 191 fitness tests were included. Among the 191 fitness tests, 99 (i.e.,52%) assessed cardiorespiratory fitness through 75 different protocols, 28 (15%) assessed muscular fitness through 16 different protocols, 14 (7%) assessed flexibility through 13 different protocols, 45 (24%) assessed balance through 40 different protocols, 2 assessed speed with the same protocol and 3 were multidimensional tests using one protocol.

C_LIO_LIMost of the protocols lacked validity and reliability data, which limits the confidence on the association of fitness with maternal and neonatal health-related outcomes, which is still scarce.
C_LIO_LIWe advocate for an expert consensus to be developed in the following years to achieve the goal of appropriate and effective PF assessment during pregnancy.

The study aims to develop machine-learning (ML) classifiers for discharge prediction of SCI patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

MethodsClinical data of patients diagnosed with SCI were extracted from the publicly available ICU database. A total of 105 ML classifiers were initially developed to predict the discharge destination (dead, further medical care, home), and then the top 3 classifiers with the best performance were stacked into an ensemble classifier (Esb-Clf). To balance the accuracy and the feasibility, the complete Esb-Clf was finally simplified with top 10 features (simplified Esb-Clf). The micro-average area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the prediction performance of difference ML classifiers and 6 doctors artificial prediction.

ResultsA total of 1485 SCI patients were used for the early and the recent prediction of discharge destination. In the early prediction, the micro-average AUC of the Esb-Clf and the simplified Esb-Clf was 0.846 and 0.835 during the independent testing, respectively. While in the recent prediction, the micro-average AUC of the Esb-Clf and the simplified Esb-Clf was 0.898 and 0.892. Performance of both the Esb-Clf and the simplified Esb-Clf were superior to the doctors in the early and the recent prediction.

ConclusionsML classifiers can discriminate the discharge destination of SCI patients with high accuracy, feasibility and interpretability. Whether the simplified Esb-Clf as an online predictive tool is applicable to guiding clinical management needs further verification.",NA,medrxiv

The efficacy results from a phase 2b/3 trial of a ninth vaccine candidate, CVnCoV (CUREVAC), was announced on 16 June 20212. The low efficacy of this new mRNA vaccine, which showed only 47% protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, was surprising given the high efficacy of two previous mRNA-based vaccines3,4. A number of factors have been suggested to play a role in the low efficacy in the CVnCoV study, particularly around the dose and immunogenicity of the vaccine (which uses an unmodified mRNA construct5,6) and the potential role of infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants (which were the dominant strains observed in the CVnCoV trial)2.",NA,medrxiv
